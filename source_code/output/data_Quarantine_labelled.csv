A 10min walk along the promenade and you are there.   Arrived with no queue and simple checkin. Had booked a cityview Quad Suite but was upgraded to a harbourview which was a welconed touch.  Rooms are dated but overall clean and tidy. Beds are very firm. note, cots are only available for 9 month olds and under so if you are planning to bring toddlers you need to BYO travel cot.  also the floors are hard tiles so I used a cushion from the couch under my pop up travel cot as it lays directly on the floor.Continental breakfast was small but adequqte.  The breakfaat staff failed to point out tea and coffee and pastries more food were outside the main dining area which was a bit odd so we missed it the first morning but luckily discovered it the next morning. Pooltime was our main objective and we were not disappointed.  It is part of a clubhouse so you need to bring your hotel bath towels down with you.  Large resort style pool can handle up to 216ppl under current quarantine regulation. no booking or queuing and stay as long as you want which was a big plus!With sunny and shady spots, deep parts and warmer shallower ledges and water jets for the little ones to splash around safely.  Something for everyone and is now easily my favourite hotel pool.  We didnt seem to have our room serviced so had to ring up to have our towels changed  but they were fairly prompt about it.  They brought extra water, tissues and loo paper as well. Food options are limited in the immediate area but within 10min walk you will find Whampoa Gardens and of course you can take the free shuttle to TST if you wish.  We walked or taxied to places.

The rooms are satisfactory as is the food. The staff have been lovely and very attentive. The WiFi has been very good and reliable so far and is part of the quarantine package. I would not recommend this hotel for quarantine if construction noise bothers you. They are currently going through renovation, with quite vague time period information. Although, they do stay true to their word when they say they will try minimise noise. But it is still quite disruptive, Monday to Saturday - 9AM to 6PM. Meaning you will only get 2 days (Sunday) out of 14 days of quarantine with some actual peace and quiet.

At 2 AM the speedtest result was 4M/4M.The rooms do have wired broadband internet but it will cost 50HKD a day.After entering our room we immediately contacted the frontdesk but they told us that they were not allowed to change the rooms without approval from the government. We called the hotline and they told us it will take a few hours to days to assess our situation. They will not allow us to change hotels as that would be too much of a risk. The hotel later called us that they did not have any other rooms. A bit of a nasty start of our stay in HK, but we will be able to see our family and friends :-).

Check in time is 3 pm and I arrived at the lobby about 10 or 15 minutes before.  On entering, I was immediately directed to a gentleman across from the reception desk who promptly gave me a queue number and told me 4 others were in line ahead of me.  I was invited to take a seat in the lobby area and wait to be called and also given a health questionnaire to fill out.  After a few minutes, I got up to ask if there was a separate line for HHonors members, was asked my membership level and when I replied Diamond, the response immediately changed and I was escorted by another gentleman to the elevators and sent up to the Executive Lounge on the 59th floor for check in. As it was complimentary afternoon tea time by then, reception at the Executive Lounge quickly checked me in and at the same time made a booking for me for afternoon tea and also for cocktails.  Afternoon tea is served in 2 seatings at 3-3:45 pm and 4-4:45 pm and cocktails is served in 2 seatings at 5-5:45 pm and 6-6:45 pm.  The 45 minute slots are to allow for management of capacity for social distancing and to allow for a 15 minute cleaning and disinfecting period between seatings.  While the time slots might be a bit tight, especially for having drinks and snacks at cocktails, I did understand and appreciate the need for such a rigid system to comply with health and safety standards.  The time limit was less an issue with afternoon tea as it was served simply as a set with a scone, an hors d'oeuvre, some fruit and a bite size piece of dessert.  With cocktails, there is a small buffet with some hot appetizers, cold canapes, salad, soup, fruits and dessert and also several bottles of wine so the decision making and selection of food, especially on first encounter, did make the time slot a bit tight to enjoy the experience. The first visit to cocktails was confusing.  Since afternoon tea was served to me as a set and I was asked what beverage I would like, I assumed the same would be the case for cocktails and actually sat around confused for a few minutes before I finally flagged down someone to ask how the system worked for cocktails.  Would have been nice to have someone explain the system to me and show me where the buffet was realizing it was my first time at cocktails.  Apart from that first slip in service, I must say the service in the Executive Lounge is superb – attentive but not intrusive, very warm and giving the impression I was at a nice private club. Food quality in the lounge is very good and the foods were changed each day so I had new items to try at my two afternoon teas and two cocktails during my 2 night stay.  Breakfast was also complimentary in the Executive Lounge, but I opted to go to the Garden Café instead for the larger buffet selection. The highlight of the lounge of course is its expansive harbour view.  Especially at cocktail time when the sun is setting and the lights are coming on, the Executive Lounge provides a classic panorama looking across to Kowloon. I had booked a peak view room and was upgraded to a peak view executive room.  I selected a room on the 58th floor as there are stairs to go up to the Executive Lounge on 59th, bypassing the need to wait for elevators.  The rooms are very large at about 452 sq ft with a king size bed facing the peak view, a large TV to the side, a work desk and an armchair in the corner.  The bathroom has double sinks and a separate shower and bathtub.  There are nice toiletries from Shanghai Tang in the bathroom.  Décor is standard Conrad – lots of wood and leather finishes in the room and marble in the bathroom.  It is perhaps a bit dated without some of the fancy gadgetry of newer hotels (such as a TV embedded in the bathroom mirror instead of attached as a unit to the side of the bathroom), but is classic opulent comfort.  Bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed very much waking up looking at the peak view.  The side armchair though had a cushion that was much too soft and I found myself sinking in it despite not weighing very much. There were plush bathrobes in the closet, and a coffee station with a Nespresso machine and a large fridge under the counter. I found the light switches a bit confusing as there was a master switch by the entry and then down the corridor by the bathroom door two switches for the corridor and bathroom lights.  However the room lights seemed to be all individual knob switches at each floor or desk lamp.  There were two overhead lights in the ceiling above the bed and I struggled to find the switch to turn them off, not wanting to use the master switch to turn everything off and then wander back from the corridor in the dark.  Eventually I found some switches at the side of the bedside table right up against the bed that controlled the overhead lights above the bed, the floor lamp and the nightlight – not an easy find at the end of a late evening after showering and getting all comfy and ready for bed. Due to pandemic restrictions, use of the pool had to be booked in advance in one hour slots with one booking allowed per day.  I did not get a chance to use the pool but looked out at it and it seemed to be set in a location that does get good morning sun.  I did use the gym several times and it was well equipped and had partitions between treadmills and stepper machines for Covid safety. I opted to have the complimentary breakfast in the Garden Café.  On both Saturday and Sunday morning, I found it reasonably tranquil before 8 am but by 8:30 or 9 am, the restaurant was quite full and busy.  Breakfast dining is limited to a one hour slot, understandable given the demand from patrons.  The buffet had Chinese, Japanese and Western foods, a made to order eggs station and a made to order soup noodle station.  The soup noodle station had interesting lobster meat balls in addition to wontons and regular pork meatballs you could select.  Chinese dim sum items tended to be Chiu Chow items.  Again, I was pleased to find that they did switch up a few of the items each day so I could try different things on my two breakfasts there. All in all, I enjoyed my 2 night staycation at the Conrad very much.  After the pandemic put an end to my leisure travel for the last couple of years, I really did miss having a nice hotel stay other than a quarantine hotel.  With a staycation, I rediscovered the pleasures of good direct person to person service which of course cannot be part of any designated quarantine hotel stay. The superb understated service in the Executive Lounge I thought did much to make up for the relative age of the hotel and ably represented the Conrad brand in fine form.",1,"dear vanctraveller,thank

I didn’t expect much as it was 50% promotion, so I called the reservations team if there were duplicate bookings.Even though they are unable to help because the booking source was from travel agent but Fanny went beyond the services and trying to raise my concerns to Hotel.comShe called me personally and also check on my preferences, child’s name, name all the in house amenities that are available for kids. She is very details oriented and shared they only provide filter water, so would recommend to bring my own or take sometimes to boil with the kettle. Another staff I want to highlight is Jasper, he also followed up on my reservations several times after I raised my concerns about COVID. I am very particular on cleaning and I’ve studied effective cleaning methods and detergents for household for COVID.  He has escalated my concerns to the Duty Manager but Jasper has kind of hints me their team has prepared some arrangement for my staycation, so would appreciate I give them a heads up if I am cancelling my order.Check In & in room amenitiesCheck in is smooth and quick. They managed to accommodate my early check in requests. I checked again with the manager again if there are any confirmed COVID patient or guests who are under quarantine staying here, the Duty Manager told me there is none. However, I shared with him there was a confirmed case back in March after checking with CHP, he said he just the job recently and the confirmed case only stayed here for a few hours.  I was quite disappointed with his dishonesty. I advise travellers to check with CHP or DOH directly, I guess hotels will just deny as a norm?While I was still worried about the sanitization of the hotel, I totally forgotten my worries when he walked us into an upgraded harbour view suite! I let the floor to ceiling window widely opened and sea breeze just blow in all the time to the flat! There are tons of kids amenities, balloons, colour pencils, games, diaper bins, potty, bottle sterilizer, kids snacks, kids toothbrush were set in my room. The kitchenware is well thought- wine opener, cutleries for kids, rice cooker, coffee machine etc. Only downside there is no baby shower gel provided. But my 2 years old boy was extremely excited with the room and he is self-entertained. Super thankful to the team who has prepared all this!DesignThere are no sharp angles and it is enclosed with a STUNNING sea view balcony.

Less obstructive redesign and even more elegant lightings make Four Seasons much more welcoming, friendly and spacious. To welcome our visit, Benjamin at the front desk was more than helpful. A clear explanation, a sweet congratulation and some useful advice on our room choices and dining  arrangements. It was very kind of him to remember us the other day when we checked out. The already stunning harbor view guest room, receiving a redesign  was a delight to the eyes, with a sharp modern black and white color tone, subtle yet pristine Chinese closet artwork, and more user-friendly lighting modules. The bathroom having a dim yet clear lighting module would create a  atmosphere while saving energy. A remarkable impression based on mixed cultures truly left a spark in my heart.The package we chose included dinner at LUNG KING HEEN. It is a calming evening at the window table as the family enjoyed various phenomenal dishes and Nico's graceful tea ceremony. I am impressed by their great choices of oolong tea, as it was obviously tea leaves of high standards, with little to no bitterness at all. 1  All the staff at LUNG KING HEEN are polite, considerate and professional, aiming to create a comfortable, luxurious yet warm dining experience.

Not reliable for Work From Home activities. Make sure to have an effective data-packed mobile plan and make use of your own hot-spot. The staff rests the wifi router on demand but it is seldom stable for more than a couple of hours.DeliveryThe hotel accepts to bring to your room any food or light parcel delivered to the lobby. Take advantage of this because the service provided by the hotel is very limited (see below) !Bed and linenThe bed mattress is 100% wrapped in a noisy plastic foil. Pillows are also fully covered with a noisy plastic wrap inside their cases. The mattress is covered with ikea's basic mattress protective cover, the one held with rubbers in the angles and that creases everywhere.Bed linen is guaranteed 1st price selection, partly synthetic fabric.Bath towels can be quite used : some unravel and fray on the sides (yet not all). No holes but fingers entangling in threads happens regularly.Windows3 out 4 windows (angle room) are locked. The staff would not provide a handle or tool to open them. No way to have some air flow through the room, unless you manage tool delivery.CleaningNo cleaning or laundry services... and limited means to do the cleaning yourself : soap bars are supplied on demand.No toilet brush. No cleaning products, wipes or cloth.No vaccum cleaner or broom, not even to lend.No wire or hanger to dry your laundry after hand washing.Please consider this situation in case of mite or dust allergies.Communication with staffCommunication between staff and resident through WhatsApp, due to a broken room phone.Food and beverages2 complimentary 25cc bottles of water for a 3-week-long stay.Weekly meal selection : for each meal, choices among 2 dishes and 2 or 3 paper-packed drinks (room temperature Hong Kong style milk tea, coffee or sweet soy milk). No plain water or juice available. Whatever the choice, rice will be included in every single meal : breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don't expect continental breakfast or similar fancy dish. Fresh veggies and fresh fruit offered only once a week.Weekly meal delivery time selection : breakfast offered at 8 or 10,  lunch at 11:30 or 14 and dinner at 18 or 19. But times can vary up to 1:15 hour before or after the selected times.

Beats Mandarin Oriental!,"To be honest, I had never heard about Indigo hotel before and picked it as alternatives were scarce at the time of booking. I had previously done two quarantine stints, one in Mandarin Oriental Singapore and one in Cordis Hong Kong, both 5-star hotels. With this track record, I was a little bit nervous as pictures and reviews can only tell you so much about the real experience. I am now 5 days into my quarantine stay and can only conclude that Indigo hotel not only surpasses my expectations but is in fact doing a better job than my previous quarantine hotels. It all boils down to details and the hotel delivers on most.I notice people complain about the food. Well, as a F&B professional,  I can assure you it is totally adequate and quite enjoyable considering it is served in disposables, which put natural limitations to the food experience. In my previous quarantine hotels, it was obvious they were both ""cutting corners"" to reduce food cost. They did so by serving similar dishes all the time so one could have chicken and rice with different sauces for 3 days in a row. As a consequence I did A LOT OF  delivery. Indigo hotel sent me a list prior to arriving where I could pick my meals so there is enough variation based on what I want. It is obvious they have a chef who knows how to cook, manifested in the ingredient quality and taste. Therefore I have NOT DONE ANY DELIVERY so far, which is quite an achievement. The hotel offers a complimentary first batch of the minibar and snacks, which none of the preivous hotels did. Indigo offers complimentary nespresso capsules and bottled water. Mandarin Oriental requested me to boil my own drinking water. I had to chase them on nespresso capsules. In terms of facilities, I notice people complain about the size. Well, I have lived in Hong Kong for 12 years and I can assure you that 300 sqf is considered large in this country. Whilst my previous quarantine hotels had larger rooms, the layout of mine is perfectly adequate for a 14-day stay. The office space is not facing the bedroom so perfect for video meetings. The floor to ceiling windows make the room look bigger than it is. The small lounge area is adequate for watching TV and reading. With an open bathroom, it also adds to the impression of a larger room. All the light switches and power sockets are made for road worriors. All in all, clever and well done!I notice people complain about the staff and their language skills. Well let's address the staff service first. I am a Hong Konger and travels frequently. The staff here are quick and expedient like crazy. It is in their nature and culture and I have not been let down in Hotel Indigo. They have so far all gone the extra mile for me and I can only salute them for a great job. In terms of language, this is Hong Kong and not England. Indeed they may have an accent but let me assure you they speak adequately and only ignorant westerners with english mother tongue would have the audacity to complain.

I checked in last night around 10:20pm to the hotel, arriving from Singapore.  It has been less than a day since I have moved in and I have experienced by far the worst hotel experience.  I hereby would like to make a complaint about the terrible services with the following matters:--  HotlineFirst and foremost, the number 3963-6388 is NOT reachable.

It was cold last night and I was unable to sleep.  The central ventilation is so cold that it is unbearable.  Hope you understand that during 14 days of quarantine, we are to be in good shape. I am extremely concerned about my health,  and am unsure whether I would get sick for the next 13 days. - ThermoUnder the current 14 days quarantine protocol, I am to take temperature, day and night for 14 days in ensuring I am not getting sick.  The thermo I was given last night when I checked inis broken.  Without being able to connect to hotline, reception.  I have not been able to undergo checking the temperature of my body and I am uncertain when I will be able to get a new one provided that I am unable to communicate to anyone since I checked in last night. - EmailWith the lack of response, I tried requesting for a blanket due to the cold weather, yet I have not yet had any reply.- Delivery serviceNoted from the website that delivery service can be arranged in allocated timeslots.  My parents and my friend have dropped off food, blankets, jackets at 2:45pm and 3:36pm respectively. It is now 4:14pm and I have not yet received anything, not to mention there is not a microwave or a fridge in the room.

Won’t even rate it a one if I can rate zero.,"The experience is so bad that I can’t even rate it a one. I’ve stayed at a hotel for compulsory quarantine. Not even 5 days passed I have encountered a bunch of problems. The hotel is not cleaned to the level as expectation. The sheets are not clean as they are suppose to be. I have dirty pillow case upon check in. Then it’s this bathroom leaking happened and it’s not fixable as well. It took at least 5 minutes and even more for me to reach to any person of the hotel via phone. By the way, the quality of the bed is really cheap and very hard to sleep on. Also the WiFi connection is really poor. If you are a person who really count on WiFi to work, I suggest you to prepare your own internet in advance before leaving your country. There won’t be any chances for you when you arrived Hong Kong airport. Going back to the hotel, I find it so stupid that guest must pick up their food when they heard it’s being delivered or else it’s thank you for paying to eat air. After a phone call complaints, I got an answer from the front desk with this lady whose attitude is unacceptable since the first night that it was my problem and sorry she can’t do anything about it. All the other guests know so you should know better (she might phrased in the other words but this is what she means). She was even trying to argued that it was stated on the rules being given, which is NOT. She even suggested that I should wake up and take the delivery then go back to sleep. The problem is I don’t know when exactly delivery is going to come. Anyways, the overall experience is really bad, the food is bad and the quality of the service is bad.

Honestly, I don’t think it’s even worth that much of the money I spend on. 非常糟糕！我根本無法給它任何分數。我住在酒店進行強制隔離。 不到5天我就遇到了一堆問題。酒店沒有達到預期的清潔水平。 床單並不像他們想像的那樣乾淨，入住時枕套就是髒的，然後浴室還漏水，而且也無法修復。我花了至少 5 分鐘甚至更長時間才能通過電話聯繫到酒店的任何人。順便說一句，床的材質真的很便宜，而且很難睡。此外，WiFi 真的很差。如果你是一個依靠WiFi工作的人，我建議您在出國之前提前準備好自己的網路，到達香港機場時你將沒有任何機會。回到酒店，我覺得這太愚蠢了，客人聽到食物被送到時必須馬上拿起他們的食物，否則謝謝你花錢吃空氣。一個電話投訴後，我得到了前台的答复，女員工的態度從第一晚開始就無法接受，說這是我的問題，很抱歉她對此無能為力。 所有其他客人都知道，所以你應該更清楚（她可能不是一字不差的這樣說，但這就是她的意思）。她甚至試圖爭辯說給出的規則中有說明，但事實並非如此。，她甚至建議我應該醒來等食物然後再睡。 問題是我不知道確切的送到的時間是什麼時候。無論如何，整體體驗真的很糟糕，食物很糟糕，服務品質也很差。 我絕對不會再住在這裡了。一個建議，不要被價格所吸引，這一定是有原因的。 老實說，我認為它甚至不值得我花那麼多錢。",0,,,"total disaster! won’t even rate it a one if i can rate zero. the experience is so bad that i can’t even rate it a one. i’ve stayed at a hotel for compulsory quarantine. not even 5 days passed i have encountered a bunch of problems. the hotel is not cleaned to the level as expectation. the sheets are not clean as they are suppose to be. i have dirty pillow case upon check in. then it’s this bathroom leaking happened and it’s not fixable as well. it took at least 5 minutes and even more for me to reach to any person of the hotel via phone. by the way, the quality of the bed is really cheap and very hard to sleep on. also the wifi connection is really poor. if you are a person who really count on wifi to work, i suggest you to prepare your own internet in advance before leaving your country. there won’t be any chances for you when you arrived hong kong airport. going back to the hotel, i find it so stupid that guest must pick up their food when they heard it’s being delivered or else it’s thank you for paying to eat air. after a phone call complaints, i got an answer from the front desk with this lady whose attitude is unacceptable since the first night that it was my problem and sorry she can’t do anything about it. all the other guests know so you should know better (she might phrased in the other words but this is what she means). she was even trying to argued that it was stated on the rules being given, which is not. she even suggested that i should wake up and take the delivery then go back to sleep. the problem is i don’t know when exactly delivery is going to come. anyways, the overall experience is really bad, the food is bad and the quality of the service is bad. i wouldn’t stay here again ever. one suggestion, don’t be so attracted to the price. it must happen for a reason. honestly, i don’t think it’s even worth that much of the money i spend on. 非常糟糕！我根本無法給它任何分數。我住在酒店進行強制隔離。 不到5天我就遇到了一堆問題。酒店沒有達到預期的清潔水平。 床單並不像他們想像的那樣乾淨，入住時枕套就是髒的，然後浴室還漏水，而且也無法修復。我花了至少 5 分鐘甚至更長時間才能通過電話聯繫到酒店的任何人。順便說一句，床的材質真的很便宜，而且很難睡。此外，wifi 真的很差。如果你是一個依靠wifi工作的人，我建議您在出國之前提前準備好自己的網路，到達香港機場時你將沒有任何機會。回到酒店，我覺得這太愚蠢了，客人聽到食物被送到時必須馬上拿起他們的食物，否則謝謝你花錢吃空氣。一個電話投訴後，我得到了前台的答复，女員工的態度從第一晚開始就無法接受，說這是我的問題，很抱歉她對此無能為力。 所有其他客人都知道，所以你應該更清楚（她可能不是一字不差的這樣說，但這就是她的意思）。她甚至試圖爭辯說給出的規則中有說明，但事實並非如此。，她甚至建議我應該醒來等食物然後再睡。 問題是我不知道確切的送到的時間是什麼時候。無論如何，整體體驗真的很糟糕，食物很糟糕，服務品質也很差。 我絕對不會再住在這裡了。一個建議，不要被價格所吸引，這一定是有原因的。 老實說，我認為它甚至不值得我花那麼多錢。",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

First time, missing 20% of the food; second time, half of the food; third time, my entire order was missing...Alex took the initiative, telling me not to worry and that he would look into it for me. He contacted the restaurant to make sure that it did send out the food, then he traced it to the delivery guy, who said he delivered the food to my door. Alex knew something was wrong, but he started to find proof before making the claim. He checked the CCTV and knew for sure that there was no one except for hotel staff on my floor during that period. Then, he contacted Deliveroo to report the incident and arranged a replacement delivery for me. All was done within a short time, perhaps one hour.Most importantly, Alex did not flaunt what he did -- I was curious and asked about how he solved the mystery. That's how I know what happened.I was deeply impressed by what Alex did: His kind care, understanding of the frustrating situation, taking the initiative to solve the problem, and solving it in such a highly efficient manner.Overall, I had a wonderful three week stay, and I have recommended Renaissance Harbour View Hotel HK to all of my colleagues, friends and family.",1,"dear andreaxu888thank you for sharing your stay experience on tripadvisor!with a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations in overall. and i will surely share your compliments with our service team especially to alex. we look forward to welcoming you back soon.kind regards,cherry tamassistant front office manager - guest services & loyalty","Responded October 16, 2020","great concierge service! i would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the great service and care i received at renaissance harbour view hotel hong kong. as a quarantine guest i relied on the concierge for the purchase of phone card, food delivery and other errands. the staff has always been courteous, efficient, and helpful. i would like to say thank you to all of them, especially a few of them whose names i remember--alex lo, jefferry de castro and bernard ng.the concierge, alex lo, was particularly helpful.as a quarantine guest, i had to rely on food delivery for the first 14 days. i ordered through deliveroo several times. starting from my second order with deliveroo, however, my ordered food started disappearing even though it was shown as ""delivered"" online. first time, missing 20% of the food; second time, half of the food; third time, my entire order was missing...alex took the initiative, telling me not to worry and that he would look into it for me. he contacted the restaurant to make sure that it did send out the food, then he traced it to the delivery guy, who said he delivered the food to my door. alex knew something was wrong, but he started to find proof before making the claim. he checked the cctv and knew for sure that there was no one except for hotel staff on my floor during that period. then, he contacted deliveroo to report the incident and arranged a replacement delivery for me. all was done within a short time, perhaps one hour.most importantly, alex did not flaunt what he did -- i was curious and asked about how he solved the mystery. that's how i know what happened.i was deeply impressed by what alex did: his kind care, understanding of the frustrating situation, taking the initiative to solve the problem, and solving it in such a highly efficient manner.overall, i had a wonderful three week stay, and i have recommended renaissance harbour view hotel hk to all of my colleagues, friends and family.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,,

The room was a good size (>200 ft) and the twin beds were very comfortable. I slept very well most nights. I had enough space to set up my work station as well as to carry on with my daily exercise routine (core and pilates). My room faced the housing estate nearby and was relatively quiet. The aircon was also easy to use and did not make much noise. We were also allowed to open windows which helped with the air flow. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of supplies. The shower had great water pressure and was easy to to use; the towels were also lovely and soft. There was a drying rack and clothes line provided for drying clothes, which was very helpful for the 3-week stay. The service from the staff was excellent. They were always polite, professional, and helpful on the phone; and were able to address my queries (eg, requesting cleaning products, how to connect my computer to the TV via a HDMI cable). Anything my family/friends sent to me were delivered to my room within 15 minutes, highlighting the efficient service. There was also reminders about my COVID tests the day before which was very helpful. I had to wait to check in as I came on a full bus, but the checking out process literally took 1 minute. The food was very tasty, especially given the price. The menu had two choices for every meal and were pretty standard HK lunchbox/tea restaurant-type food (probably costs around HKD 50 at least) but of higher quality. The portion size was perfect. You could also swap out drinks for fruit cups. I loved the fried fish, sweet/sour pork, and roast duck and I am still at awe at how fresh the prawns were; plus I enjoyed having veggies with little oil for my lunch and dinner. You can choose from several food delivery slots (which is great for organizing intermittent fasting) and you could easily skip a meal if you'd like; but I never had the need to order takeaway food as I was very happy with what I was offered. I also used the fridge and kettle, which is helpful especially for storing outside food and boiling your own water. We also got a mid-autumn festival treat from the hotel consisting of a heart-shaped mooncake and traditional snacks like peanuts and taros, which was a lovely and thoughtful surprise, as I was not able to spend that day with my family. I also had a good ""work from hotel"" experience. There were lots of places to plug in and charge my multiple devices. As expected, the free wifi was not very fast, although it was straightforward to connect. For those who would like to stream movies or have zoom meetings, I would recommend preparing your own ethernet cable to plug in (with the ethernet cable, the internet speed was up to 80Mbps). Overall (and to the surprise of all my family and friends), I felt energized, healthy, and refreshed after the 21-day quarantine period. I would describe my experience here as a work/staycation rather than compulsory quarantine, and the experience improved both my physical and mental health. I managed to work full time (to a different time zone), exercise, sleep/relax, connect with my friends online, and complete a personal project, all to similar comforts that I would have at my own home.

Whenever I needed any supplies or ordered takeouts, they would entertain my request immediately. I must thank them for that.As for the room, it was actually bigger than I saw from the photos. My room has a queen size bed, a cabinet, a work desk. Two night tables; after I spreader out my two large suitcases, I still had room to workout (exercises on yoga mats) without hitting anything. There are also plenty of shelf spaces for me to put my everyday necessities like skincare, books and photo frames. I felt like I was moving to a small apartment!The bed is comfortable, not so hard and not so soft, just perfect for me. The bathroom is awesome! I like the fact that it is very simple but there is enough storage space (great news for someone who has to stay there for 21 days). The shower is AWESOME! The water gets heated very fast and the pressure is just perfect. Since there wouldn’t be any room services for people who are being quarantined, it is very important not to spill water everywhere. The design of the shower area is so good that I never experienced any trouble cleaning after myself. I am grateful that the hotel is doing her best to keep guests feel like home.Last but not least, the food. The HK government requires all quarantine hotels to provide three meals a day. The hotel serves delicious western style meals. As a Chinese, I occasionally ordered Chinese food takeouts from Deliveroo and Foodpanda (too much western style food already in the states). A small tip for the Chinese guests; if you plan to order Chinese food from the food delivery apps, tell the hotel to serve soup and salad instead of canceling that meal, so that you can still eat enough veggies for the day.The hotel is close to everything and has a lot of nice restaurants around, I’m going to eat my lunch there right after the checkout.I highly recommend this hotel for regular stays or quarantining.Took this picture when I left the room.",1,"dear christina_szeto,thank you for taking your precious time to post a review of an excellent stay at the luxe manor. providing health and safety environment for all customers is our priority and we strictly follow the prevention guideline from centre for health protection of hong kong sar government.we were delighted to learn that in general our services met with your expectations and that you enjoyed your stay with us. positive comments about our room, facilities and meal are certainly a driving force for continuous improvement to exceed our set quality standards.in the heart of tsim sha tsui, the luxe manor is surrounded by lots of cuisines, chinese, japanese, and korean etc, which are an ideal choice for the foodie.thank you again for taking the time to offer this positive feedback as well as your stay in our hotel.look forward to welcoming you back at the luxe manor in the not too distant future.yours sincerely,fiona wongfront office manager","Responded February 1, 2021","a wonderful quarantine experience during covid i took my courage and came back to hongkong from the states for the chinese new year.i thought i would go crazy during my 21 day quarantine but it turned out that everything was perfect and i didn’t want to leave the hotel.the hotel staff were doing their job to keep me safe and comfortable. whenever i needed any supplies or ordered takeouts, they would entertain my request immediately. i must thank them for that.as for the room, it was actually bigger than i saw from the photos. my room has a queen size bed, a cabinet, a work desk. two night tables; after i spreader out my two large suitcases, i still had room to workout (exercises on yoga mats) without hitting anything. there are also plenty of shelf spaces for me to put my everyday necessities like skincare, books and photo frames. i felt like i was moving to a small apartment!the bed is comfortable, not so hard and not so soft, just perfect for me. the bathroom is awesome! i like the fact that it is very simple but there is enough storage space (great news for someone who has to stay there for 21 days). the shower is awesome! the water gets heated very fast and the pressure is just perfect. since there wouldn’t be any room services for people who are being quarantined, it is very important not to spill water everywhere. the design of the shower area is so good that i never experienced any trouble cleaning after myself. i am grateful that the hotel is doing her best to keep guests feel like home.last but not least, the food. the hk government requires all quarantine hotels to provide three meals a day. the hotel serves delicious western style meals. as a chinese, i occasionally ordered chinese food takeouts from deliveroo and foodpanda (too much western style food already in the states). a small tip for the chinese guests; if you plan to order chinese food from the food delivery apps, tell the hotel to serve soup and salad instead of canceling that meal, so that you can still eat enough veggies for the day.the hotel is close to everything and has a lot of nice restaurants around, i’m going to eat my lunch there right after the checkout.i highly recommend this hotel for regular stays or quarantining.took this picture when i left the room.",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,,

The night we arrived, we checked in at the reception at 12 midnight & they gave us food containers that were supposed to be served to guests in between 6-7pm. So the food was already sitting at the reception for few hours & it was cold by the time it was given to us. Second, when we entered the room, it was not in its best state, as there was dust everywhere. We did not have the energy to do the cleaning at night, as we were already tired of all the formalities the airport staff did before allowing us back to the hotel. We were already at the airport for 5-6 hours before coming to the hotel. The next morning when we woke up, we did all the cleaning of the room, as if it wasn’t clean at all. Even the carpet in the room seemed like it wasn’t cleaned for ages. There were hair everywhere on the carpet.  We requested the hotel staff to provide us vacuum but unfortunately they did not allow, & provided us an alternative cleaning kit, which did not even include the right materials for us to clean the carpet. So I ended up sitting with my phone torch light & picking up every hair stuck on the carpet. Third, it was the water not going down the drains in the washroom. We again called & told the staff about it but they only provided us with a pump which pulled out a lot of dirt from the drains. I was disgusted by it.  However, we still are in quarantine at the hotel & cannot wait to get out of this dirty room. Overall, we are not happy with the entire experience of staying at Ramada Harbour View. Will not recommend this hotel to anyone ever. ‍️P.S. even the food is not according to standard in this hotel. We already paid for 3 meals included in our package of 21 nights quarantine.

This is my second stay in 2021 with Sheraton Tung Chung - First in Easter, and this time during Christmas. Between two stays, I totally spent 9 days there so I guess my review would help some of you considering staying with them.Below is a long read. I seldom do this but since it is a comparatively new entity and locates in a less-known area to non-locals, I am more than happy to depict in details my experiences and several tips for your consideration. In sum, it is a perfect hotel for a get-away trip from buzz of city with hikes, beach, plus outlet shopping with reasonably priced great food and drinks. I agree with other comments that if you look for anything luxurious, you should look for elsewhere.Hope you will find below info useful.LOCATIONNormally local staycation would last overnight or 2 at most. The length of my stays does speak for something. For first-time travellers from abroad, Hong Kong has 2 Sheraton-s - The iconic (historic) one at downtown Tsim Sha Tsui, right next to The Peninsula, and this one in Tung Chung opposite the airport opened to public only in 2020 fall. Its location on Lantau Island makes it a perfect base for excursion to the gorgeous countryside. During my past two stays, I enjoyed sunshine on Cheung Sha, the longest beach in Hong Kong, and a few hikes along (arguably) the most scenic and roughest terrain in town. Instead of staying in downtown and commuting an hour or two to reach Lantau, I could shrink my commute time to 30-45 mins given how remote these places are.HARDWAREAs a Sheraton, good location is almost a given. Like aforementioned, it is one of the newest properties in town. You can expect slick interior and up-to-date amenities. The whole tone of the hotel follows a contemporary trend of wood plus touches of beige/golden hues which generates warmth and cosiness. All electric outlets come with USB ports (essential to me as a frequent business traveller pre-COVID). I believe there is nothing missed comparing to Sheraton standard when it comes to in-room amenities. Some may find it not up to scratch, but this new Sheraton adopts a more environmental-friendly policy. The hotel gets rid of all one-off bottles of shower gel and shampoos and installs refillable, large bottles mounted to walls (NB: I was staying in room instead of suite). Tooth paste and brush are packed separately so that you don't waste another item when you only use one of them. N'espresso machine is equipped in every room (if I am not mistaken) if that is of your concern. It certainly makes my day a lot easier. Personally, I have very particular demand on mattress and the one Sheraton has is just good for me. It's supportive yet not overly hard on my back. Same goes for pillows. There is no pillow menu but I guess you can always make request ahead of time of check in.SERVICESLike my fellow visitors who commented before me, Sheraton Tung Chung has one of the best teams in town. You can easily sense their genuine care about yourselves and try their very best to address your need. I want to give a big shout-out to Alex Chung who looked after my stays! Although sounding trivial, the daily housekeeping and turn-down service have been pretty consistent. In some more luxurious hotels I stayed, the way my room was made could be different between days. Consistency to me scores many points. NEIGHBOURHOODFor people who have not been there, it is a bit hard to imagine what the property looks like. Surfing onto Google Map may not help much (for now). This property is a one big development with 3 wings laid out as a letter ""Y"". One of the 3 wings houses the Sheraton, while the remaining 2 wings being the Four Point Sheraton, which has been a designated hotel for travelers' quarantine after landing into Hong Kong. For those who might share concern related to COVID, I must highlight the fact that there has been ZERO issue happened with the Sheraton even the quarantine hotel is directly connected (but completely segregated). That speaks for great deal of prep work the hotel team must have put in place, which deserves recognition.The base of the building is indeed a small complex with restaurants, convenient stores, a gym and several other shops. You don't have to worry about grocery shopping if need arises. Be minded that the 7-11 closed before midnight; the tuck shop next door also stocks great varieties of stuff including fresh food. I believe it is owned and run by local Indians, and interestingly it has good range of Indian/South Asian specialities hard to find elsewhere other than places like Chungking Mansion. In fact, the Nepalese restaurant on first floor is a good place for fruity cocktail and ethnic dishes.The hotel may play safe in their advice, in reality the biggest outlet in Hong Kong, the Citygate, is only 10+ min stroll away instead of 15-20 as hotel would tell you. The hotel operates a shuttle service connecting the hotel and the Tung Chung MTR station, also where the Citygate is. From Tung Chung, you will find yourself at Central on a 35-min MTR ride.Shuttle departs from Tung Chung MTR at every :00 and :30 min hourly between 7am to 10:30pm; and from hotel every :20 and :50 min hourly between 7:20am to 22:50pm (as of December 2022).In case you miss hotel’s shuttle, there is a public bus option. Take 37M from the public bus terminus at Tung Chung MTR/the Citygate and get off just at the first stop (“Yu Nga Court/Ying Hei Road”). You may not find this detail on Google Map yet. This route did not pull off at this stop during my Easter stay but added a stop here as confirmed during my Christmas stay.Worthy to note that there are more shops and restaurants in adjacent housing estates (by the name of “Century Link” and “The Visionary”, heading eastward from hotel along Ying Hei Road) in 100-150 meters’ away, including larger, more posh grocery markets, and even a Starbucks.HOTEL DININGThere are in total 4 dining outlets in the hotel - 1. Sunset Grill, the flagship steak house2. Yue, the Chinese restaurant3. Cafe Lantau, the buffet restaurant and where most guests enjoy their breakfast4. Lobby lounge, where afternoon tea service is offered.I have tried all of them and from the bottom of my heart, they are all good - Not to the level of being phenomenal, Michelin-star studded kind of good, but excellent in terms of the quality, service and how much they charge.Sunset Grill is not inferior to any Island-side restaurant. If you happen to be in the hotel in the afternoon, and when weather allows, go enjoy a cocktail at their rooftop balcony. During Easter, I was served by their bartender who was one of the finalists in the Hong Kong bartender competition. She incorporates local (meaning Lantau Island) ingredients like Tai O shrimp paste into drinks, bearing in mind Hong Kong bar scene is one of the most competitive in East Asia (or arguably in the world; The BEST bar of Asia's Best 50 is in Hong Kong this year). On Christmas eve, I have had one of the best tenderloins. The 5-course set with pairing of one class of red costed me south of HKD 1.5k per head only, which could be a half of what you pay for the same quality and amount of food in the city.Yue's head chef, master Chung, came from famous local establishments like the Lei Garden. Chung helped Lei Garden earn a Michelin star (at their Shatin shop if my memory serves me right). Bringing with him is a very impression a la carte menu full of technical local delicacies. I tried both dinners and afternoon dim sum. They are both equally impressive. Would recommend the yuzu shrimp dumpling and swan dumpling.For both outlets, book in advance. Reservations are available online via third party apps like Chope (through which you can earn Chope points too). Perks of Bonvoy Elite members are applicable in all restaurant outlets here, which to me is a big plus.OTHER TIPSThe hotel has bicycles to rent. Though there are constructions nearby, the hotel is properly built along cost with bike trail next to it which makes cycling safe yet fun.One may ask about the noise level as the hotel is so close to the airport. I can tell you that you would notice nearly nothing thank to the noise cancelling windows. And of course speaking of its proximity to the airport, it is not actually right next to runway.Airport-facing/sea view rooms are generally bigger than city-view’s but not different significantly.The outdoor swimming pool opens daily even during winter. In the morning of 10C, I did see one guest using it. Summer time it has been very popular. Guests using pool were assigned with slot (of an hour) and advance booking was mandatory.Gym remains open 24 hours, with spacious changing and shower room. Towel and water are provided. The equipment line-up should meet most people’s training routine.Members’ lounge is next to the buffet restaurant. I would say it is a small-mid size (not the smallest) facility, offering breakfast and cocktail hour services. Nothing to complain about and I find it comfy.ON FLIP SIDE / OTHER NOTES> Talking about environment protection, the hotel shall consider abandoning bottled water and installing sanitized water dispensers (like many Japanese hotels do). This might not be applicable (soon) due to hygienic measures imposed during COVID, but for future plan.> While I like the interior overall, it is for sure not the most cutting edge or ""Design Hotel"" grade of good. It might look generic to some (like my partner), but again good enough for a new Sheraton. Let's be sensible about it > At Tung Chung MTR, there is no signpost for where to queue/wait for the shuttle. There might be restriction to install signpost at public space but I see it a really helpful one as many visitors do not know the place and direction very well.> Rooms have no bathtub if that is a thing for you.> I have not tried the mobile key but it is said to be available. You have to arrange it at check-in.Feel free to DM in case you need further tips/advice.",1,"dear henry,thank you very much for taking the time to write such an extensive review!we had many positive reviews this past year and to receive one of the nicest ones so just before the year-end is a very nice gift to us all. we greatly appreciate the time you have taken to write this.as with all comments, the ones that always stand out for me are the ones the team of hard working associates gets called out for providing yet again first class hospitality. i am indeed extremely proud of what the team has achieved over the past year and once again thank you for highligthing this.also wonderful to be reading the compliments on our dining venues which also have become well known in tung chung and beyond as great places to spend an afternoon or evening.with that i wish you a very happy 2022 and we all look forward welcoming you back soon again.until next year,sander looijengeneral managersheraton hong kong tung chung hotel","Responded December 30, 2021","one of the best on lantau island for some reasons, i hold higher yard stick for local hotels, and recommend one when i really grasp a good-enough experience. this is my second stay in 2021 with sheraton tung chung - first in easter, and this time during christmas. between two stays, i totally spent 9 days there so i guess my review would help some of you considering staying with them.below is a long read. i seldom do this but since it is a comparatively new entity and locates in a less-known area to non-locals, i am more than happy to depict in details my experiences and several tips for your consideration. in sum, it is a perfect hotel for a get-away trip from buzz of city with hikes, beach, plus outlet shopping with reasonably priced great food and drinks. i agree with other comments that if you look for anything luxurious, you should look for elsewhere.hope you will find below info useful.locationnormally local staycation would last overnight or 2 at most. the length of my stays does speak for something. for first-time travellers from abroad, hong kong has 2 sheraton-s - the iconic (historic) one at downtown tsim sha tsui, right next to the peninsula, and this one in tung chung opposite the airport opened to public only in 2020 fall. its location on lantau island makes it a perfect base for excursion to the gorgeous countryside. during my past two stays, i enjoyed sunshine on cheung sha, the longest beach in hong kong, and a few hikes along (arguably) the most scenic and roughest terrain in town. instead of staying in downtown and commuting an hour or two to reach lantau, i could shrink my commute time to 30-45 mins given how remote these places are.hardwareas a sheraton, good location is almost a given. like aforementioned, it is one of the newest properties in town. you can expect slick interior and up-to-date amenities. the whole tone of the hotel follows a contemporary trend of wood plus touches of beige/golden hues which generates warmth and cosiness. all electric outlets come with usb ports (essential to me as a frequent business traveller pre-covid). i believe there is nothing missed comparing to sheraton standard when it comes to in-room amenities. some may find it not up to scratch, but this new sheraton adopts a more environmental-friendly policy. the hotel gets rid of all one-off bottles of shower gel and shampoos and installs refillable, large bottles mounted to walls (nb: i was staying in room instead of suite). tooth paste and brush are packed separately so that you don't waste another item when you only use one of them. n'espresso machine is equipped in every room (if i am not mistaken) if that is of your concern. it certainly makes my day a lot

The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The added bonus of having two bathrooms in the suite really made our stay that much easier in the mornings.  The hotel also offers a shuttle bus ride to and from the Tung Chung MTR Station, a very efficient service.In terms of food offerings and venues, breakfast in the cafe had a good variety of both western and oriental fare, service was impeccable, friendly and efficient.  A must try is the Chinese Restaurant- Yue, dim sum lunch was very good and dinner had a good choice of dishes, all of the food served was delicious.  The Executive Lounge offered a good selection of or d’oeuvre during the evening and beverage all day.Service was top notch right from the front desk staff, concierge staff, Executive Lounge staff, folks in both restaurants and the ladies who did the refreshing of the rooms.  Some folks deserve special mention - Alex in the Executive Lounge, who went  the extra mile to help us buy a SIM card for our phone the first day that we were out of quarantine.  He went out on the rain during his lunch hour to do that for us.  Mathew was always friendly and greeted us by name every time we went in to the lounge.  At the front desk, Matthew Wong, Assistant Front Office Manager, who helped us in getting what we needed for our quarantine stay, even before we checked in through emails.  Ming at the front desk was also very helpful in helping us arrange for our laundry to be done, this was especially appreciated after our quarantine stay.  Angel, a special person, who sent my wife a birthday cake while we were in quarantine and recommended the Chinese restaurant for us to try.  Jin Yoo, the Gold Key Concierge was extremely friendly and helpful, she spoke both English and Cantonese fluently, but we were told that she is Korean.  Sheraton is lucky to have such dedicated staff.The Management Team for both Four Points and Sheraton Tung Chung are to be complemented for their leadership.

Food quality is better than most 4 to 5-star hotels lounges . If you are not a big eater, the cocktail food should be sufficient for dinner2. We stayed in the Harbourview suite. Seeing planes taking off and landing there was indeed relaxing. The infinity pool is an excellent spot to enjoy the magnificent sunset. The life-guards were friendly too.3. The Sunset Grill was awesome (as an Marriott Titanium member, a la carte menu 30% off). And of course, you can enjoy the beautiful sun set scenery there, yet Autumn maybe a better timing to dine outdoors4. Cafe's breakfast buffet variety and quality ranks top three among other Marriott hotels. As Elite members we could get the foods and enjoy them at the Executive Lounge next door. There are 4 kinds of ice-cream flavours.We told Alex that we are looking for a quarantine hotel after our coming new year UK trip.

I’d say everything is better than I expected so far despite I had encountered difficulties with the Online booking and payment procedure because there was hardly any stuff answering the customer service line. I was lucky that eventually a stuff, Ms Tsui who answered the phone after my uncountable attempts and she helped to solve my booking issue. Also, they replied my enquiries via emails as well. When it’s time for settling the payment, problem occurred again when the system was verifying the transaction. I definitely needed help but neither my calls or emails get answered. The payment was settled by a friend of mine who literally went to the hotel and got it done.I was a bit concern after reading a few negative reviews about this hotel let not alone I’ve had difficulties with the booking and payment’s, so I’ve brought lots of personal stuffs/snacks which hopefully can help myself to feel better. I assumed that I would be entirely isolated from the world which means nobody would take notice of my call whenever I need any services from the hotel during my stay. However, unexpectedly, I would like to say the customer service has been good which is totally different from the previous experiences. I have been asking different room services many times. Calls were picked up by either female or male staffs quite quickly with good manners. The stuffs/food I asked for were delivered by my door before long. Really appreciated their services. Thank you!The only downside perhaps is the food. The quality of the taste and the way of cooking of the meals are not consistent, sometimes they are tasty, unfortunately sometimes not. I was brought up in HK. In my impression, food is always delicious elsewhere particularly the hotel’s. I’m not sure if the food management is affected by their contract of being a designated quarantine hotel with the government.

This is the worst hotel experience I've had in a long time and I live in hotels. Actually,  I've lived in better hostels. The first problem was Customer Service when trying to pay online. Their website wouldn't work properly so I called and got no answer. Then, I actually had someone in Hong Kong go there and call me on WhatsApp. He asked for a manager and that person said to me, we're busy . When I told her the website problem she said,  (and I quote) IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.  Finally I had yet another person in Hong Kong go there and pay for me since their website would not take either of my cards.  My bank had never received the transaction so it was not an issue with my cards. I have a very specific health issue and emailed the hotel twice to enquire about their menu because I'm a vegetarian with a digestive disorder that I just returned from New York doctors treating. No one replied to either email. After arriving I tried my best to eat a t least 3 bites of the bland white colorless rice and over cooked what ever that was but my stomach started to hurt after the 3rd meal. It was the same crap every day . I called the front desk and was told to order Food Panda. When I asked then why do I have to pay for food I can not eat,  I got the same ""it's not my problem attitude"". I said the food was all carbohydrates and clogged my stomach making me sick. The person on the phone replied ""SO"".  I just returned from the  US to see doctors because HK doctors said it would be 2 years before they can give me a colonoscopy. Now eating this food was getting me sick AGAIN.   I finally had to call friends in HK to drop of a variety of fruits, avocado's, juice, oatmeal etc. or anything I could eat in a hotel.  The room is so small I can not do yoga or any exercises short of marching  in place , squats, and stretching. There's no desk or chair so I have to sit  up  in bed fo 21 days. There's only a tiny stool. The wall paper would be ok if the seams were actually glued down, and the curtains are old, wrinkly and too long for the window box area. They are also dirty with mold spots on the bottom. The bathroom had a moldy smell when I entered and I am VERY allergic to mold. The shower has a plastic hose attached to the cheapest shower head available and it's not adjustable. Just attached to a hook on the wall. There's a bath tub but it's small and uninviting with molded  water damage around the edges. The sink is tilted so it's not safe to set toiletries on safely. They always fall.  The shower curtains are old and need replacing . The toilet paper is behind the toilet so you got to be flexible taking care of business. This is really NOT what I expected from the Ramada name and I would NEVER stay here again or recommend the place.  21 days is a long time to deal with this.  I give it 2 stars and definitely NOT 3. 1 star for shelter; a roof .  And 1 star for not being a dirt floor.",0,,,"very  disappointing i  booked this hotel for 21 day quarantine thinking i would receive internationally acclaimed ramada service. this is the worst hotel experience i've had in a long time and i live in hotels. actually,  i've lived in better hostels. the first problem was customer service when trying to pay online. their website wouldn't work properly so i called and got no answer. then, i actually had someone in hong kong go there and call me on whatsapp. he asked for a manager and that person said to me, we're busy . when i told her the website problem she said,  (and i quote) it's not my problem.  finally i had yet another person in hong kong go there and pay for me since their website would not take either of my cards.  my bank had never received the transaction so it was not an issue with my cards. i have a very specific health issue and emailed the hotel twice to enquire about their menu because i'm a vegetarian with a digestive disorder that i just returned from new york doctors treating. no one replied to either email. after arriving i tried my best to eat a t least 3 bites of the bland white colorless rice and over cooked what ever that was but my stomach started to hurt after the 3rd meal. it was the same crap every day . i called the front desk and was told to order food panda. when i asked then why do i have to pay for food i can not eat,  i got the same ""it's not my problem attitude"". i said the food was all carbohydrates and clogged my stomach making me sick. the person on the phone replied ""so"".  i just returned from the  us to see doctors because hk doctors said it would be 2 years before they can give me a colonoscopy. now eating this food was getting me sick again.   i finally had to call friends in hk to drop of a variety of fruits, avocado's, juice, oatmeal etc. or anything i could eat in a hotel.  the room is so small i can not do yoga or any exercises short of marching  in place , squats, and stretching. there's no desk or chair so i have to sit  up  in bed fo 21 days. there's only a tiny stool. the wall paper would be ok if the seams were actually glued down, and the curtains are old, wrinkly and too long for the window box area. they are also dirty with mold spots on the bottom. the bathroom had a moldy smell when i entered and i am very allergic to mold. the shower has a plastic hose attached to the cheapest shower head available and it's not adjustable. just attached to a hook on the wall. there's a bath tub but it's small and uninviting with molded  water damage around the edges. the sink is tilted so it's not safe to set toiletries on safely. they always fall.  the shower curtains are old and need replacing . the toilet paper is behind the toilet so you got to be flexible taking care of business. this is really not what i expected from the ramada name and i would never stay here again or recommend the place.  21 days is a long time to deal with this.  i give it 2 stars and definitely not 3. 1 star for shelter; a roof .  and 1 star for not being a dirt floor.",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,,

But because it has a transparent, flexible refund policy, which is important in this uncertain pandemic situation we're in, and its superior room is well within my budget, I went ahead and booked it anyway. And I'm writing this review to balance out the other negative reviews out there because I don't regret spending my quarantine in Ramada and actually had a pleasant stay.Of course, if you want a five-star rating for every criterion you have on your checklist for a long hotel stay, you've got to be willing to pay for it. That's how it is, especially in Hong Kong. You get what you pay for. I'd say Ramada North Point is a decent hotel and offers good value. You get a spacious room that comes with a spacious private bathroom; the windows fully open with a universal key that you can request from the hotel reception; three meals a day are inclusive; the Wi-Fi is fast enough for regular browsing; and the hotel staff I encountered were responsive and courteous to requests, which could include deliveries through apps from supermarkets and many restaurants in the vicinity. It's true the hotel is past its prime and isn't spick and span. I especially don't like how the corridor smells. It smells weird. They probably sprayed a lot of disinfectant products there. The meals aren't fancy either. However, it's really about what you prioritize and again, how much you're willing to pay for it. Preparation also matters. If you bring stuff that you know will make you happy and will make your stay more comfortable, that will make a whole lot of difference. It did for me.

I hope this review helps someone out there.(By the way, not all quarantine hotels can assist you with your luggage.)",0,,,"good enough for 21-night quarantine prior to my quarantine stay, i read some really harsh, discouraging reviews about ramada grand view hotel (north point) online. but because it has a transparent, flexible refund policy, which is important in this uncertain pandemic situation we're in, and its superior room is well within my budget, i went ahead and booked it anyway. and i'm writing this review to balance out the other negative reviews out there because i don't regret spending my quarantine in ramada and actually had a pleasant stay.of course, if you want a five-star rating for every criterion you have on your checklist for a long hotel stay, you've got to be willing to pay for it. that's how it is, especially in hong kong. you get what you pay for. i'd say ramada north point is a decent hotel and offers good value. you get a spacious room that comes with a spacious private bathroom; the windows fully open with a universal key that you can request from the hotel reception; three meals a day are inclusive; the wi-fi is fast enough for regular browsing; and the hotel staff i encountered were responsive and courteous to requests, which could include deliveries through apps from supermarkets and many restaurants in the vicinity. it's true the hotel is past its prime and isn't spick and span. i especially don't like how the corridor smells. it smells weird. they probably sprayed a lot of disinfectant products there. the meals aren't fancy either. however, it's really about what you prioritize and again, how much you're willing to pay for it. preparation also matters. if you bring stuff that you know will make you happy and will make your stay more comfortable, that will make a whole lot of difference. it did for me. personalize the hotel room of your choice and it'll be easy to overlook anything you might not like about it. every hotel has its pros and cons, but after weighing them, this is the hotel quarantine experience i ended up with. i hope this review helps someone out there.(by the way, not all quarantine hotels can assist you with your luggage.)",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

In short, the room is fine, the food is not. The room that I got is perfectly decent - not great, but decent. There are definitely signs of wear and tear, but nothing terrible. Besides, it was clean and felt like someone did a through job cleaning it - even the A/C vents (usually the dirtiest thing in a hotel room) seem to have been cleaned. The room comes with a kitchen sink, a cooking plate (although cooking is prohibited), and small fridge, big enough to place some milk, juice, butter, and leftovers. There is also a TV with a small number of non-Chinese channels, and (this is pretty important) the internet is actually good. I had no issues with streaming and video calls. My one complaint with the room is that the AC was a bit noisy, not terribly so, but when you can't get out of the room or open the windows, it's kind of annoying to listen to it 24/7. Finally, there is a sufficient provision of toiletries, toilet paper, and  garbage bags (you can put your garbage out in front of your door twice a day).Now to the bad stuff - the food. There really is no way around it: it's just terrible. Day after day it's meat in some sort of unappealing sauce + some rice. The type of meat changes, but it's often not of very good quality. The sauce changes a bit also, but that's about all the variation you will get. Some of it is tolerable, much of it is not. There are some vegetables in the sauce, but not a single fruit during my whole stay. In any case, it is certainly the worst food I was ever served in any context. Airplane food is infinitely superior to this. Student cafeteria food is infinitely superior to this.  This is how I imagine prison food. I tried to eat it as much as I could because I didn't want to order in (especially given what I am already paying for this stay), but the good news is that you can order both food and groceries and they will be delivered to your door promptly.

If I were paying Kerry rates it'd be a zero, but I'm not and it isn't.The Grand View is one of, if not the, cheapest quarantine options available but if you know going in where the pain points are, I think some may find the value proposition still feasible if not even attractive.Issue #1: Food. I'm not sure if they contracted out to a grade school kitchen or what but three times a day they'll hang a set ""meal"" on your door that I feel most reasonable people would consider to be, well, objectively poor. After two days I called down and cancelled delivery outright as even in its failing as enjoyable sustenance I still felt terrible wasting it.Solution #1: Delivery. Yes, this WILL adjust the value prop substantially, however there are a plethora of excellent options within delivery range between Deliveroo and Food Panda including Starbucks which had a hot coffee hanging on my door within 20 minutes of order every morning.Issue #2: Internet. It's clearly a shared pipe for the entire hotel that is massively insufficient at its size. In the early, early AM, you could comfortably pull 10Mbps, but once the sun rises and people log on, it devolves into dial up. In addition to that, I was constantly getting booted off it entirely rendering it effectively worthless.Solution #2: Phone pairing. If you don't have an unlimited plan, grab a SIM or call your provider and see if they can set you up with one temporarily (or sell you a higher cap for the month). With 3HK, I'd consistently pull 12-15Mbs, solving my internet woes completely.Issue #3: Heat. When I got here it was cold, uncomfortably so. Upon noticing the fans only blew cold air despite being switched to 'hot', I was informed by staff that the Ramada was a ""no heat hotel"" which, to recap here, meant 'Quarantine Ramada' was officially a ""no heat, no internet, no food"" hotel.  A travelers dream.Solution #3: Well, for me unfortunately, it was threaten to call the DOH. Within an hour there was a space heater out front of my door which worked brilliantly however with the temperature rising now you probably won't need it. That said, should you feel otherwise, there'd be nothing stopping you from having a friend drop one off.Outside of that, is the room dated? Yup.Bed stiff, comforter prison sheik? Absolutely.Does it have a weird kitchenette with inoperable range hood and stove top? Curiously, yes.Will the staff ever voluntarily check up on you? Lol, no.If you don't speak Canto will you be relegated to whatever is the least-bad reality television show on either Discover or Nat Geo? Yes, always, forever.But in the end did *I* really care about any of that? No, not really.Once I mitigated or came to terms with the Big 3, the other quirks quickly melted away, largely on account of the two HUGE perks of the room that truly carried me through the experience: Space & View.The very FIRST thing I did was take the small but quite functional round-top table they provide you and move it right beside the masssssive bay window that not only looks out upon the beautiful harbour but will *bake* your room with sunlight all day long. I don't think it's possible to understate the value of this in the context of three weeks of isolation. I mean, don't get me wrong, come my 21st day, I'll run, not walk out of this room but after a few days back at the office, I'll legitimately miss the watching the harbor traffic while I tear through my daily emails and the inimitable skyline while crash at night.In addition to that, the windows open *completely*, allowing you to let in as much of the smells and sounds of North Point as you find appetizing.And, as a consequence of moving the table and creating a warm work nook, you free up a few extra square meters by the aforementioned inoperable kitchen area creating a rather respectable space for whatever kind of workout you're into.In the end, between the light and space I never felt congested or claustrophobic in this room and that was a big, if not the biggest fear, when shopping on a budget for quarantine digs.Lastly, they supplied me with many months worth of toiletries which was nice even in its ridiculousness, some extra water, and are zippy as hell with my deliveries.So, to conclude, your mileage may vary based on requirements but, if you set your expectations accordingly, in this quarantiners opinion, for the money, you can *probably* do worse.",0,,,"set (quarantine) expectations accordingly out of the gate, let it be known, my rating is conditioned to the price point here.  if i were paying kerry rates it'd be a zero, but i'm not and it isn't.the grand view is one of, if not the, cheapest quarantine options available but if you know going in where the pain points are, i think some may find the value proposition still feasible if not even attractive.issue #1: food. i'm not sure if they contracted out to a grade school kitchen or what but three times a day they'll hang a set ""meal"" on your door that i feel most reasonable people would consider to be, well, objectively poor. after two days i called down and cancelled delivery outright as even in its failing as enjoyable sustenance i still felt terrible wasting it.solution #1: delivery. yes, this will adjust the value prop substantially, however there are a plethora of excellent options within delivery range between deliveroo and food panda including starbucks which had a hot coffee hanging on my door within 20 minutes of order every morning.issue #2: internet. it's clearly a shared pipe for the entire hotel that is massively insufficient at its size. in the early, early am, you could comfortably pull 10mbps, but once the sun rises and people log on, it devolves into dial up. in addition to that, i was constantly getting booted off it entirely rendering it effectively worthless.solution #2: phone pairing. if you don't have an unlimited plan, grab a sim or call your provider and see if they can set you up with one temporarily (or sell you a higher cap for the month). with 3hk, i'd consistently pull 12-15mbs, solving my internet woes completely.issue #3: heat. when i got here it was cold, uncomfortably so. upon noticing the fans only blew cold air despite being switched to 'hot', i was informed by staff that the ramada was a ""no heat hotel"" which, to recap here, meant 'quarantine ramada' was officially a ""no heat, no internet, no food"" hotel.  a travelers dream.solution #3: well, for me unfortunately, it was threaten to call the doh. within an hour there was a space heater out front of my door which worked brilliantly however with the temperature rising now you probably won't need it. that said, should you feel otherwise, there'd be nothing stopping you from having a friend drop one off.outside of that, is the room dated?

Certainly it didn't hurt to do a once over cleaning myself on high contact points just for peace of mind.  I hope their AC filtration system is up to COVID prevention standards.Two areas that can be improved:Carpet had quite a bit of left over hairs that required more than just regular vacuuming in between customers.Pillows being something we spend many hours at night on close contact I am hoping the hotel sanitizes the whole thing, not just pillowcases.  Covering the pillow inside with small plastic garbage bag does not give me much confidence.Internet/entertainment 5 starsBeing cooped up in a room for 21 days not being able to step outside the door, free internet becomes critical for sanity sake.  Fortunately at average 10Mbps internet speed connecting to meetings, video calls WhatsApp Etc is no issue.  Though the Amazon Fire stick that I brought were not able to fit behind the narrow space between the 40""TV and the outlet.  So resort using my tablet and VPN I am able to access Prime Video, TUBI movies etc easily.TV has about 20 channels including Some English programming.FOOD 4 stars: here's the nice surprise.  Even at the cheaper (by almost HK$300/day) Balanced Eat menu compared to the Eat Well Menu, meals were good portion sizes and mostly tasty with the exception of few meals.  The advantage of this hotel location and plenty of outside eateries means one can order food delivery easily to supplement hotel meals (that $300 difference in hotel option you can order lots of food).Customer Service 4 stars:Pentahotel answered my initial booking emails very promptly and was accommodating as my booking overlapped the 5th and 6th cycle which is set by the HKSAR and the government didn't put out the 6th cycle list until mid Oct, so it was a little anxiety inducing.  Fortunately the hotel allows tentative reservation which alleviate the uncertainty.  And they were also accommodating when flight schedule changed.During quarantine supplies were replenished on request promptly.  Though the bottled water that some previous reviewers mentioned are not free anymore after the initial 35x300 ml water ran out.Room design 4 stars::. I do like the chic, industrial black look and the layout.  At 22sq meters (200 sa feet plus) it's spacious for 1 person Hong Kong standard.Value 5 stars::. Quarantine hotels 36(5th cycle) 40 (6th cycle) ranges from $500+/nite to tens of thousands dollars per night if one wants to live it up.  HOWEVER none will let you out the room nor normal housekeeping is provided during the entire stay.

No issues with the room or the bathroom. I found the wash line going across the shower room useful for drying washed clothes. One small detergent was provided for the entire stay, staff do eventually provide more after several requests. There is an efficient daily online ordering system for amenities which come in abundance. Staff do follow up on queries and issues. They do offer help and overall customer service is fairly good. TV is new and the screen is fairly big which is great for Netflix and watching TV series. Organised and arranged for a swift discharge from the hotel on the final day. Carried out lugagges and arranged a taxi for us. Check in and check out process was quick and efficient. Negative aspects:Except for a few dishes the food can be bland and tasteless. The meals are on repeat week after week and eventually I had to order takeaway on deliveroo and food panda 3 times a day. I have attached images of the meals.Staff are not always clued up with the processes or procedures in place and sometimes lack problem solving skills. However, eventually problems are solved after explaining many times and going back and forth a few times. This involved the front staff agreeing to pick up takeaway food round the corner but then decided against it after we had ordered the food 45mins later. Dietary requirements should be made in advance as it may be difficult to accommodate as we had experienced initially. If you do not eat beef, a solution offered by the front staff will be to order your own food. You will also be charged for a small pot of milk for making tea. On arriving on our first day there was a miscommunication and we were informed dinner would arrive to our door immediately thought 10pm we were still waiting for our dinner and upon calling we were informed dinner was over and we would get a sandwich instead. After going back and forth, for 30mins we received our dinner eventually. Cleaning equipment is available in the form of a lint roller but is not available to be ordered on the ordering system. This should be made known to guests so they can clean the carpets during their 21 day stay. This should be even more of a reason because staff are not allowed into the room to carry out cleaning services. Detergent and washing up liquid are also not available to order and must be constantly chased up over the phone. Overall, the stay was okay though I would say not good value for money. For the price paid I would have expected better food.

I want to try and point out potential areas for improvement.Before that, here are a few things I appreciated about the hotel-1. Smooth Check-in and Check-out procedure. The staff co-operated in both processes and was very efficient. Took less than 5 mins for check in and barely a min for the check out. Great efficiency!2. Polite and friendly staff. I am always appreciative of hospitality which revolves a lot around friendly and polite staff. Never had an issue with the staff and it was always very responsive and prompt.3. Spacious room. Being locked in a room for 3 weeks isn't easy. I certainly found it very comfortable having a spacious room which gave me enough area to walk around and be active.4. Substantial amenities including supplies and in room equipments. Very much appreciated the fact that we were provided with laundry detergent and dish-wash soap.Potential areas for improvement-1. The hotel should start focusing on more sustainable business practices. Since it is a big hotel, certainly it has a lot of rooms. When each meal arrived, the amount of single-use plastic being used I saw just blew my mind. On an average, I noticed about 8-12 plastic containers being used, 4-5 plastic bags being used, plastic cutlery being used. This being the quantity of plastic for 1 room per day, I can't wrap my head around the total single use plastic being used in total daily. I strongly suggest you to look for more sustainable alternatives to replace the plastic usage.2. I used to get the food from the vegetarian menu. Not sure what the chef's take on vegetarian food is but it could certainly use some basic seasoning and ensure it meets the basic standards as expected.  For example, the spaghetti came with no seasoning or sauce. It also seemed that it was boiled without salt and oil which led to the pasta sticking together and tasting absolutely bland. I also  received either almost burnt bread toast for the breakfast or cold to a point where it would be hard to even tear the bread by hands forget about chewing. However, it continued to happen a little too frequently. Although, after informing the staff, they replaced it with fresh ones. Moreover, it might be good to reconsider the portion sizes for the mains. I have attached sample photo for your reference and would leave you to assess if it truly reflects the quality you would like to offer.3. For 21 days being locked in a room, it is important to have some cleaning equipment for the room. I would highly recommend you to start providing compact vacuum cleaners which could at least ensure sufficient hygiene.4. It might be good to check and improve on the mattress quality. The mattresses sunk in the center to a point where the mattress springs used to hurt and the mattress shape would be deformed to a point where it would become uncomfortable to sleep and resulted in back pain.5. Ensure proper room cleaning before check-in. While all the surfaces were sparkling clean, the WC was all stained on the inside.While these are the main areas of improvement I could identify, I'm certainly open for any  discussion you may need.The 2/5 rating is simply because of two reasons- Didn't find enough value for money when considering the quality of food, mattresses and hygiene, and found the hotel to really ignore environmentally friendly practices.Hope you might consider these suggestions and especially focus on moving towards more sustainable business practices.",1,"dear prabhav,thank you for choosing to stay at the courtyard by marriott hong kong and providing your honest feedback on tripadvisor.providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations. as a teachable moment, your experience of dining issue and room condition have been shared with the restaurant manager and housekeeping manager who joins me in offering not only our sincere apologies for the team’s shortcomings, but our commitment to resolving these issues in order to improve your staying experience in the future.once again, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. we appreciate you choosing to stay with us during these unusual times.best regards,kate changuest services manager","Responded October 15, 2021","big scope to improve the business practices. this is based on my recent experience with the hotel during my 21 days quarantine. i want to try and point out potential areas for improvement.before that, here are a few things i appreciated about the hotel-1. smooth check-in and check-out procedure. the staff co-operated in both processes and was very efficient. took less than 5 mins for check in and barely a min for the check out. great efficiency!2. polite and friendly staff. i am always appreciative of hospitality which revolves a lot around friendly and polite staff. never had an issue with the staff and it was always very responsive and prompt.3. spacious room. being locked in a room for 3 weeks isn't easy. i certainly found it very comfortable having a spacious room which gave me enough area to walk around and be active.4. substantial amenities including supplies and in room equipments. very much appreciated the fact that we were provided with laundry detergent and dish-wash soap.potential areas for improvement-1. the hotel should start focusing on more sustainable business practices. since it is a big hotel, certainly it has a lot of rooms. when each meal arrived, the amount of single-use plastic being used i saw just blew my mind. on an average, i noticed about 8-12 plastic containers being used, 4-5 plastic bags being used, plastic cutlery being used. this being the quantity of plastic for 1 room per day, i can't wrap my head around the total single use plastic being used in total daily. i strongly suggest you to look for more sustainable alternatives to replace the plastic usage.2. i used to get the food from the vegetarian menu. not sure what the chef's take on vegetarian food is but it could certainly use some basic seasoning and ensure it meets the basic standards as expected.  for example, the spaghetti came with no seasoning or sauce. it also seemed that it was boiled without salt and oil which led to the pasta sticking together and tasting absolutely bland. i also  received either almost burnt bread toast for the breakfast or cold to a point where it would be hard to even tear the bread by hands forget about chewing. however, it continued to happen a little too frequently. although, after informing the staff, they replaced it with fresh ones. moreover, it might be good to reconsider the portion sizes for the mains. i have attached sample photo for your reference and would leave you to assess if it truly reflects the quality you would like to offer.3. for 21 days being locked in a room, it is important to have some cleaning equipment for the room. i would highly recommend you to start providing compact vacuum cleaners which could at least ensure sufficient hygiene.4. it might be good to check and improve on the mattress quality. the mattresses sunk in the center to a point where the mattress springs used to hurt and the mattress shape would be deformed to a point where it would become uncomfortable to sleep and resulted in back pain.5. ensure proper room cleaning before check-in. while all the surfaces were sparkling clean, the wc was all stained on the inside.while these are the main areas of improvement i could identify, i'm certainly open for any  discussion you may need.the 2/5 rating is simply because of two reasons- didn't find enough value for money when considering the quality of food, mattresses and hygiene, and found the hotel to really ignore environmentally friendly practices.hope you might consider these suggestions and especially focus on moving towards more sustainable business practices.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

Thanks Sheraton!,"Room Review ️️️️️Our room is Deluxe King City View. We feel very blessed that we could see the harbour which has made a huge difference to our quarantine lives here. Thank goodness. The room size is decent. After putting a yoga mat on the floor, it still has some extra space. If you plug your iPhone into the ihome dock, you can play some music through the speaker to smooth your nerves. With our aromatic humidifier and the music, I feel calmer. There is also a HDMI socket on the wall. We brought the HDMI cable for watching Netflix films. The only negative is that the volume for the English Channel ( Pearl ) is set to a maximum of 60 which is a too low. Food review ️️️️Got the tips from some people, I asked the staff for two plates & some cutlery, so that we could save some plastic ones, and hopefully with the good food on the proper plates, life won’t be miserable so quickly. Also thanks to those who mentioned that they received too many oranges ... Now we get either a mixed fruit cup or a cake at dinner time. Salad is served with lunch every day. Re drinks, you can choose from the beverage menu to go with your meal. It is very nice to have five options for lunch and dinner every day. The portion is very good for us (except for the noodles choices), and we seldom need to eat our own snacks or order extra from outside. If you are a fan of Thai cuisine, they do the Thai vegetables curry pretty well. The western dishes like the baked salmon, the salmon sandwich and the burger are great too. Unfortunately their seafood and prawns are not very fresh sometimes. The noodles in donyum soup has rooms for improvement. For breakfast, we tried all 8 types. All are very nice. I like the American breakfast, the waffle breakfast and the bagel breakfast. My husband enjoys the Japanese and the Hong Kong ones. Review on Amenities ️️️️️In addition to the usual amenities, bottles of water, coffee sachets and teabags ..., the hotel also provides us with a cloth for wiping the toilet bowl, a sponge for washing dishes, a pair of gloves plus two small bottles of detergents for washing clothes and dishes respectively. If necessary, you can call “0” to ask for more. So you can save some hassle for bringing your own. Re the amenities - you can scan the QR code and fill in the google form for getting more. Review on service ️️️️️In general the service is excellent and efficient. The staff are very polite and courteous. They always deliver the stuff outside our room quickly. There are just some rare occasions that the coffee or the sauces fall over a bit inside the meal bags.

I stayed at Kew Green Wanchai in September 2020. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, I stayed at another hotel for my mandatory quarantine period of 14-days after which I moved to this hotel. I had stayed once before at this hotel when it was known as Metropark Wanchai and that was a long time back. This time I stayed for 5 nights and had an overall amazing experience. The teamwork is truly commendable. All the staff at the front desk, housekeeping are so friendly, helpful and they always greet you with a smile which honestly is something so important in the hospitality industry. There were two people in particular who really helped in making my stay wonderful. The first was Bo Chan. He is the Chief Concierge at the hotel and the other beautiful, Angela Mak, Operation Manager.  I am a travel blogger and belong to the hospitality industry, so I always love to talk to people and get their perspective about the city and especially since this stay was during COVID-19, so there was plenty to learn from someone living and working in Hong Kong.  I got this opportunity with Bo. I thoroughly enjoyed my lovely conversation with him - just chatting about Hong Kong in general and getting his input on various things. He is truly a professional person and knows the guests who are staying at the hotel by name and greets and talks to them as if he has known them forever. The other person who made an impact on me was Angela. Extremely professional lady. She is someone who truly goes out of her way to make you happy. I had a small issue in my bathroom and she moved my room to a better one, hardly in any time and called me twice during my stay to check if I was comfortable, and whenever we met in the lobby, I felt like I was talking to a friend who I have known for some time. Unfortunately, time did not allow us to have a long chit-chat session, but we promised each other that the next time I am in Hong Kong, we will go out for a drink and have a girly chit-chat. I guess I made a new and kind friend.   Little more about the hotel. The location is excellent. It is in the heart of Wanchai. Public transport is easily available around the hotel. If you are into the nightlife of Hong Kong then look no further as plenty of pubs are within walking distance from the hotel. A convenience store is across the road and behind the hotel. There is also Wellcome Supermarket across from the hotel. Plenty of reasonable shopping is also accessible by foot and best are the massage parlors which are everywhere.  However, I have my favorite and I am a regular there. So once again, thank you everyone at Kew Green Wanchai for making my stay memorable. Sending regards to all of you and hope to see you all again, very soon.

Party favorites were given to every guest along with a glass of champagne.2. My birthday fell during my stay and I was treated with a bottle of wine and a birthday card from the staff. I was totally surprised and just the fact that the hotel acknowledged my birthday was impressive! When I first arrived in Hong Kong I did my mandatory 14- day quarantine at another hotel then I followed that up with another 2 weeks at another hotel. Those 2 hotels combined did not come close to the great customer service at the Kew Green Hotel!

When I arrived at the hotel at the first day, the staff Kelly and Alan have helped me to check in smoothly. When I went up to my floor, the housekeeping lady Lisa was waiting for me outside the lift and she showed me around the room and assured me that I can always reach out when I need any assistance.

I requested to replace the mini fridge which I was told was about 10 degrees for a colder one to store medication. This was around 1:30am just after checking in and housekeeping replaced the fridge immediately. Housekeeping were also able to provide a washing up bowl to hand wash clothes. Takeaways were promptly delivered to my door and rubbish collection were at set times between 15:00-16:00 and 21:00-22:00 with plenty of rubbish bags and sacks provided for used towels and bed linen. Hotel reception called at 15:00 every day to record my body temperature. I stayed in the Executive Studio room on the 16th floor facing Hennessy Rd, which was clean and traffic noise was only slightly audible. It did not disturb sleep. The room had the following features:- Widescreen tv with an HDMI cable- Mini-fridge - Sofa- Glass coffee table- Study desk and chair - Walk-in shower- Air purifier - Comfortable bed- Multiple windows that could be opened wide - Laundry services were also provided - In room dining menu from the hotel restaurant Kew Space - Kettle with tea and coffee packets- No coffee machine, minibar or conventional room service providedRoom features I didn’t like so much:- Aircon is a bit loud even on the lowest setting- In general Wi-Fi was fast but on video calls with 10+ people, video quality suffered. There is an ethernet port that can be used but it isn’t much faster.- The travel smartphone provided (Handy Phone) had issues calling some UK numbers. It would automatically hang up when calling a number after around 20 seconds of the dialling tone.After quarantine I stayed in the hotel for 5 more nights in another Executive Studio room on the 11th floor. This time there was a coffee machine, minibar and room service provided, but no rubbish bags and the windows could not be opened. A temperature scan was required every time you entered the hotel. My thanks to Chief Concierge Bo Chan and his team who were quick to respond to requests throughout the stay.

However, this hotel is quite comfortable with a spacious room and the staff is very helpful and attentive to all of your needs.  I would specifically like to thank Dianne as well as the entire staff including Tom, Wilson, Ankee, Angela, and Simon Liu.  Although I couldn’t go out during this time, the location in Wan Chai near many restaurants was still important as you need to rely entirely on delivery apps like Foodpanda, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats while in quarantine.  The hotel was very helpful with this and I was able to order outside food delivery whenever I wanted.  However, there were a few things that they charged way too much for, when of course I had to stay in my room and couldn’t go out to find a cheaper option.  One was the covid test that I had to take on day 10 and then deliver to a local health clinic about 1 km away.  They charged 400hkd for delivering this- for a 1 km journey!!  Also, I needed to have 8 t-shirts and 7 pairs of underwear washed.  This costs like 580hkd (even including a 10% discount)- just for a few friggin pieces of laundry!!!  Needless to say, I only washed what absolutely had to be during quarantine.  Also, the staff was a little bit rude when I was waiting for my bags during checkout (after finishing quarantine) telling me to put my mask back on.  I had only taken it off (technically just pulled it down, not removed it) for a minute to drink some water.  Yes, I know masks are mandatory in public right now and I always wear one, but come on!!  They could have been a little more relaxed about it.  Overall, I really liked the room, was very comfortable, in a good location (for receiving deliveries), and well taken care of during my quarantine.  My only complaint, as mentioned, is how the hotel takes advantage of quarantined guests by charging insane amount for laundry and covid test delivery.  But it’s a good, solid bet as a place to stay if you need to quarantine and in the (hopefully near) future when travel normalises, it’s a great location if you’re visiting Hong Kong and want to stay in a convenient location close to lots of restaurants, shopping, transportation, and sightseeing.",1,"dear valued guest-peterjp2885kl,warm greetings from kew green hotel wanchai hong kong.thank you very much for giving us comments following your recent quarantine stay with us.we would like to express our gratitude for your kind words regarding your recent stay. it is an extremely important and great motivation for us to hear that you had a pleasant quarantine stay experience. in addition, we are very glad to hear that you liked our comfortable and spacious room, attentive and helpful staff, especially from our front office team-simon, ankee, angela, tom, wilson and dianne.  this encourages our belief in striving for excellence and exceeding guest expectations.  in addition, we are very much sorry to learn that the laundry and covid test pricing did not meet your expectation.  we treat your comments with the highest priority and your comments had been passed to the concerned department for further rectification.should you have any further comments or assistance be required, please feel free to let us know, we will be most glad to assist you.  we look forward to being of service to you in the near future!best regards,assistant managerfront office","Responded September 14, 2020","very nice and comfortable, if slightly pricey, option for 14-day quarantine faced with a mandatory quarantine upon arriving in hong kong, i knew how important comfort and convenience would be while i was locked in, completely forbidden from leaving my room.  however, this hotel is quite comfortable with a spacious room and the staff is very helpful and attentive to all of your needs.  i would specifically like to thank dianne as well as the entire staff including tom, wilson, ankee, angela, and simon liu.  although i couldn’t go out during this time, the location in wan chai near many restaurants was still important as you need to rely entirely on delivery apps like foodpanda, deliveroo, and uber eats while in quarantine.  the hotel was very helpful with this and i was able to order outside food delivery whenever i wanted.  however, there were a few things that they charged way too much for, when of course i had to stay in my room and couldn’t go out to find a cheaper option.  one was the covid test that i had to take on day 10 and then deliver to a local health clinic about 1 km away.  they charged 400hkd for delivering this- for a 1 km journey!!  also, i needed to have 8 t-shirts and 7 pairs of underwear washed.  this costs like 580hkd (even including a 10% discount)- just for a few friggin pieces of laundry!!!  needless to say, i only washed what absolutely had to be during quarantine.  also, the staff was a little bit rude when i was waiting for my bags during checkout (after finishing quarantine) telling me to put my mask back on.  i had only taken it off (technically just pulled it down, not removed it) for a minute to drink some water.  yes, i know masks are mandatory in public right now and i always wear one, but come on!!  they could have been a little more relaxed about it.  overall, i really liked the room, was very comfortable, in a good location (for receiving deliveries), and well taken care of during my quarantine.  my only complaint, as mentioned, is how the hotel takes advantage of quarantined guests by charging insane amount for laundry and covid test delivery.  but it’s a good, solid bet as a place to stay if you need to quarantine and in the (hopefully near) future when travel normalises, it’s a great location if you’re visiting hong kong and want to stay in a convenient location close to lots of restaurants, shopping, transportation, and sightseeing.",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

What's disgusting is that the hotel provided the menu in an extremely elegantly designed way (which is the same standard as other hotels at the similar price range, e.g. Kerry Hotels which charges HKD1,800 per night) at the time of booking, yet provided by far the worst food that can certainly blow your imagination on the lower end.

Strongly recommended for travellers looking for a comfortable and luxurious stay in the heart of Causeway Bay!Location: Very convenient, hotel is located on Leighton Road with convenient spaces for cars to drop off right at the entrance, which was very helpful for food/item dropoff for us in quarantine. Bell-boys were very efficient during check-in and check-out, even offering to carry my luggage to our car at the end of the street when checking out.Pre Check-in: My parents inquired about the room booking beforehand as quarantine policies were changing constantly in the weeks leading up to our return. The responses were quick and concise, even when we had multiple inquiries including booking another room for my other friends. They were extremely friendly and even asked if there were any specific requests regarding our room to be prepared before our arrival.

The kitchenette area was very well equipped with cooking utensils, microwave, kettle, fridge with freezer compartment and induction stove, which proved to be very helpful when heating up our food or cooking a small meal in quarantine. Above the kitchenette, the cabinets had multiple plates, two sets of cutlery and various wine glasses, coffee cups and kitchen tools (sharp knife, bottle opener etc). The bed was very comfortable, with a thick mattress and soft duvet and pillow making our sleep something we looked forward to every night. Electronics: Plug type G (typical for Hong Kong), many located around the room including beside the desk, by the bedside and by the sofa table. When asked for a power bar, the concierge brought a brand new power bar instantly. The TV was quite big (40+ inches) with 3-4 HDMI ports for computers and other appliances. There was a DVD player as well. The WiFi was superb (stable and fast), with no connection drops throughout our stay other than to refresh credentials (only occurred once). All the cooking appliances were quite up-to-date as well. Service: Outstanding, friendly and very responsive. When asking for water or resupply of toilet amenities, the concierge would always provide extra sets for us.

During the check-out process, they helped us bring everything downstairs and helped us load all our baggage into my car.  Lovely staff and service! Room was good size, with a desk, sofa, coffee table, as well as the best part - a small kitchenette, fully equipped with a hob and utensils, and a big fridge with a freezer section!  That was certainly the highlight of my stay - being able to cook a few easy meals without having to get takeout all the time.  We had floor to ceiling windows across our room and although we couldn't open the windows, the sun would shine into our room for the whole morning so it was truly lovely.  They also provided a heater for the winter months.  Wifi was also fast and reliable too.  I never had an issue with it! Note - we stayed here before the government imposed list of hotels.

From my booking to my inquiries about whether Lanson Place accepts quarantine stays and how the logistics of a quarantine stay work, reception and reservation staff were always quick to respond, usually within hours.  I booked quite early, before Hong Kong changed its rules to require all incoming arrivals (except those from China) to quarantine in hotels (and banning quarantining at home), so I got quite a good rate at the long stay rate for stays of 7 nights or more.  I thought compared to normal pre-pandemic hotel rates in Hong Kong, it was about half what I would have expected to pay. I noticed that current rates are about Cdn$50/HK$300 more a night, probably due to increase demand for quarantine stays since tourism is still largely non-existent in Hong Kong.  On arrival at Hong Kong International Airport, you are required to take a saliva based Covid-19 test, and you are only allowed to leave the airport to go to your quarantine hotel after you receive a negative test result.  If your flight arrives in the afternoon or evening, you will not receive your test result until the next day so generally the authorities will send you to the government designated Holding Centre for Test Result hotel to stay one night, at the cost of the government, and if you receive a negative test result the next day, you will then be allowed to proceed to your quarantine hotel to serve out the 13 day balance of your mandatory quarantine.  I booked a 14 night stay at Lanson Place as Hong Kong rules require you show a reservation for 14 nights at a hotel commencing on your arrival day.  However, Lanson Place was very accommodating and advised that since I arrive on an evening flight, if I am required to stay at the Holding Centre for Test Result hotel the first night while awaiting my test result, I could call them after arriving and they would automatically adjust my reservation to be 13 nights starting from the day after I am released from the Holding Centre for Test Result hotel.  The current Holding Centre for Test Result hotel is Rambler Garden Hotel in Tsing Yi, one airport express stop away from the airport.  It was not a very nice hotel at all.  As Tripadvisor does not permit reviews to be posted for Rambler Garden Hotel currently due to it being the designated Holding Centre for Test Result hotel and not open to the general public to book, I was advised to and did post my comments on Rambler Garden Hotel in the Hong Kong travel forums on Tripadvisor instead. I am not sure which approach is better – early or late flight into Hong Kong.  I arrived on an evening flight at around 7 pm and it took 5 ½ hours before I made it through the arrival and taking of saliva test sample process and finally arrived at the Holding Centre for Test Result hotel around 12:30 am.  Most of that time was spent standing in line in fairly slow moving lines for each stage of the arrival process.  A friend and his wife arrived in Hong Kong a bit more than a week later on an early morning flight.  He arrived at around 5:30 am, took until around 5 pm to pass through the arrival process, receive his negative Covid-19 test result, gather his luggage and leave the airport, and it was about 6 pm before he arrived at Lanson Place.  He will end up paying for 14 nights’ stay at Lanson Place whereas I will be paying for 13 nights.  However, he did not have to stay at the rather unclean Holding Centre for Test Result hotel for one night. On arrival at Lanson Place after my one night rather forgettable stay at the Holding Centre for Test Result hotel, I was delighted to be surrounded by obvious luxury at Lanson Place.  Check-in was quick.  There was a couple dealing with a complaint about laundering of their clothes when I arrived so staff at reception took me over to the adjoining lounge area to process check-in without the distraction of the other couple’s issue.  I was given a piece of paper with the rules for a quarantine stay, given a key card and told that the key card is a single use key which will open my door once only.  In other words, the key card served to ensure I did not try to leave my room during my quarantine stay.  All rooms on my floor are quarantine stay rooms, and I understand 6 floors of the hotel were being used  for quarantine stay guests at the time I checked out in early December.  However, the hotel also advised that not all of the rooms on a quarantine floor are used so that they can maintain a bit more spacing and isolation for quarantine guests.  I was in Room 1602 and there were only 9 rooms on the 16th floor.  My friend was on the 12th floor and he indicated there were 10 rooms on his floor.  I asked reception on checking out and was told there were 199 rooms in total at Lanson Place, but some are used as long stay service apartments rather than for hotel use. As it was a 2 week quarantine, I booked a slightly larger deluxe room instead of the basic room to give myself a bit more room and to have a distinct separate bed area and living area so that it would be easier to set up a semblance of a normal routine for myself each day.  The hotel website indicates deluxe rooms are between 440 and 500 sq ft.  I found the room to be very spacious – the bed area has a king size bed and a work desk, with a small TV on the wall, the living area has a couch, an oval low table and a larger TV, the bathroom has a shower only but it was a very spacious shower with rainfall showerhead and a separate hand held showerhead, and the kitchenette was well equipped with a microwave, a two burner induction stovetop, a sink and a large under counter fridge with a good sized freezer compartment also.  Two sets of plates, cups and cutlery were provided, there was a cutting board, a couple of cutting knives, a large cooking spoon and a wine bottle opener, and a stainless steel kettle and a cooking pot were also provided. There was no toaster in the room so I called housekeeping to ask if one was available.  Fortunately, while they have a limited number of toasters only, they did have one available for my use.  The decor of the room is very modern and clean.  My room was a corner room and with floor to ceiling windows on two sides in the bed area and on one side beside the living area, it was very bright in the room.  For the daytime, there are semi-sheer curtains with a pale white top section and a dark brown bottom section.  For evenings, there are blackout curtain shades that can be lowered electronically.  I did note though that the bathroom has semi-sheer glass walls which face the living area windows so in the evening I had to make sure the blackout curtain shades were lowered as otherwise the building across the street would presumably be able to see somewhat into the bathroom if the lights are on.  The corner windows in the bed area has a great view overlooking Leighton Road.  As buildings facing that side are not very tall, I was not looking into other people’s living or work space but instead had a fairly unobstructed view for Hong Kong, given how crowded the Causeway Bay area is.  St. Paul’s Hospital is located right across the street from my bed area and I could see out a couple of blocks to the Rosedale Hotel down the street and the South China Athletic Association facility past a few old building blocks. The room seemed very clean.  I ran my finger across the surface of a shelf above the TV and there was no dust. Closets, cabinets, drawers and shelves were built in all around the room so there was a lot of storage space if one wanted to get settled in.  In the main closet, there was a heater for when the weather gets cold since the in room system is air conditioning cool only.  In another smaller closet, there was a fold out ironing table (with an iron in a hidden compartment under the TV) and a two step stepper-ladder for reaching the high cabinets in the kitchenette.  There was a DVD player in a hidden compartment under the living area TV, and a smaller DVD player on a shelf in the desk in the bed area.  Everything that was needed for a comfortable stay seemed to have been thoughtfully provided already. The hotel also provides a free Handy phone, which I have encountered before in Asia area hotels.  It comes with data and allows free local calls and calls to certain international destinations including back to Canada.  However, I noticed that when I call long distance, the phone seems to drop the call after about half an hour and then you have to redial to continue your conversation.  Of course, free data on the Handy phone was not needed since I was not allowed to leave my room and could not wander outside the hotel where data would be useful.  In room wifi is free and generally very good with a strong signal, but I noticed in the evenings at the desk right next to the window on the far side of the room, sometimes the wifi signal would be lost and had to be re-acquired.  In room free wifi supports 5 devices per room. As it is a quarantine stay, no in room housekeeping service is provided as staff will not enter my room.  However, housekeeping provides towels or supplies as I need if I call them.  Bottled water, instant coffee, Chinese and Western tea bags are provided in room.  Bathroom toiletries are from Appelles Apothecary & Lab and while I am not a fan of heavily scented bath products, I did quite like the lightly scented Davidson plum, sweet orange, geranium & blackcurrant body wash and the Rosella, mandarin clove bud & jasmine shampoo and conditioner. Hotel reception called most days to check on me and to see if I needed any replenishment of amenities. In terms of slight complaints – I did find the beautiful above counter bowl sink to be a bit awkward to use as the faucet spout did not extend very far over the rim of the sink and so water tended to splash outside the sink onto the counter.  Also a couple of times when I called reception in the afternoon, it either rang busy or there was no answer after many rings. The hotel TV system provides both local channels and cable channels including HBO, BBC Earth, Discovery, National Geographic, CNN, CNA and many other news and financial news channels, and numerous sports channels.  I found plenty to watch in quarantine when I had the time.I am fortunate in that I have family in Hong Kong who live nearby the hotel and therefore they were able to drop off food for me every two or three days.  The large fridge and freezer compartment came in handy since I could store several days’ food in it.  The hotel requires my family to drop off the food with the concierge on the ground floor, and then they deliver it up to my room, ring my doorbell, and are usually gone back down the elevator before I can get to the door, put on my mask, and open the door.  Delivery to my room is very fast, often by the time my sister messages me she has dropped off food, it would have been delivered to my room already. The hotel does not have a restaurant so for those quarantine guests who do not have family dropping off food for them, the hotel suggests use of the Food Panda app to order food to be delivered to the hotel.  I did not need to make use of the app for my stay but I had a look to see what was available and found many choices for Western, Chinese or Asian food neaby, with many offering free delivery or free delivery for orders of a certain size and many also offering discounts of 10-20% so it would seem to me to be quite easy to be well fed during a quarantine stay. During my quarantine stay, the Hong Kong government announced plans to change the 14 day mandatory quarantine requirement for arrivals through the airport to require passengers to quarantine only at designated hotels.  To become a designated quarantine venue for overseas arrivals, a hotel must accept only quarantine stay customers and no others, and must also arrange to provide meals and bus transfer from the airport so that quarantine guests will not need to take public transport.  As of my check-out date in early December, details of the new program are still under consideration so I do not know when the new requirement will kick in or which hotels will choose to become designated hotels or not.  I am hoping though that the government will ensure a fairly broad range of hotels will participate in the program so that people arriving into Hong Kong will have some choice as to the level of accommodations they choose for their quarantine stay as well as location, for those who have relatives who may deliver them food.  Equally important, I have friends who dropped off snacks for me, totally non-essential food but a great distraction during a quarantine stay.  Having enjoyed a luxurious 13 days of quarantine in a spacious room at Lanson Place and having also had a chance to compare it to the basic level of the Holding Centre for Test Result hotel one night stay at Rambler Garden Hotel, it would seem to me that quarantine in a small room at a basic level hotel, especially with questionable cleanliness, would be a much tougher experience than my relatively easy confinement at Lanson Place. If you are able to quarantine at Lanson Place, I would highly recommend it.  The comfort of the accommodations and the high standards of service will make your quarantine pass easily and perhaps even too quickly.  If you are already in Hong Kong and are not subject to a quarantine, I can equally recommend Lanson Place as their high standards would seem to ease any concerns about staying at a hotel that also hosts quarantine guests.",1,"dear mr kwan,thank you so much for your detailed review.  i am so pleased to learn about your excellent stay with us.  your kind praise towards the hotel and our service team is much appreciated.your other comments regarding wifi in room, faucet design and missing calls in reception are also noted.  with regard to the wifi in room, i have already asked our it manager to have a thorough check on wifi reception.  as for the faucet design, we will take into consideration in our next renovation plan.  for the missing calls, i have instructed our sr. assistant manager to review their manning to ensure someone is looking after the reception count at all times. once again, thank you for your recommendation and confidence on us, especially during this time with the lingering pandemic in town.in the meantime, we look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back, perhaps, in the not too distant future.with best regards,alicia toogeneral manager","Responded

Read on and you’ll find out why. Hong Kong's strict Covid protocols required me to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine upon my arrival from the US two weeks ago. For many weeks before departure, I carefully weighed many options based on personal experience and knowledge along with feedback from other ""quarantineers"".  In the end, my experience at Lanson Place proved I could not have made a better choice. If you think about it, a quarantine stay tests a hotel more than any other type of visit. You are literally in the room and fully dependent on the hotel's ""hardware and software"" for two weeks, and Lanson Place was such a great experience on all levels that I actually ENOJYED the lock up! Someone on a Facebook quarantine support group asked how difficult it was to be cooped up for 14 days, and my response was Lanson was such a serene pleasure that I would consider making it a two week retreat annually. The personal touches and care began before check in. The hotel’s team worked with me to ensure my reservation would be coordinated with my somewhat unpredictable arrival date due to testing and other Covid formalities upon arrival into HK. They were flexible and accommodating and put my mind at ease.  And they saved my return when I was not being allowed to check in for my flight because my reservation did not include my middle name, and a Lanson rep back in HK immediately emailed me a new one in the middle of the night HK time.  I was allowed to board, enjoyed my rather empty flight, passed my testing protocols at HK airport, and happily arrived back in town at Lanson Place the next day.Lanson Place may not have the brand recognition of some of the more well known luxury hotel brands, but the vibe and ambience is very similar. You get a sense of intimacy and good taste upon arrival. The feel is that you've been welcomed into a tasteful residence rather than a hotel. The hotel’s rooms manager took time to personally greet me and commiserate a bit about the challenges we all face with Covid.  She assured me they’d be at the ready for anything I’d need during my incarceration, including sending the staff out for any incidentals and groceries I might require. I usually do not book suites but given the nature of this stay, I thought springing for the additional space would be some of the best money I could spend during a year when I had virtually no travel expenses. It was a good decision. The Prestige Suite had the feel of a smartly designed one bedroom residence and was great value.  Both the living area (which was spacious enough for my yoga and golf putting matts) and bedroom (which had wonderfully comfortable bedding) were spacious and well laid out. Floor to ceiling windows provided wonderful natural light that really created a welcome openness during the long stay.  The kitchenette, which included a Nespresso machine  (something I cannot live without),  was well equipped and more than satisfactory for food prep I did myself when not ordering from the hotel or calling in Uber Eats which were delivered promptly by the front desk staff.  The avocado toast on the breakfast menu became a highlight I’d look forward to each day.  The hotel generously kept me regularly supplied with an array of Nespresso pods. The TV service was excellent. They have not scrimped on paying for global networks and provide a full array of the best names in cable/satellite TV along with the ability to mirror your laptop to the screens for viewing streaming services. Wifi coverage was strong and stable and service included multiple devices. I don’t think I had a signal drop the entire stay. It was great as I worked for weeks from the large, well equipped desk.The staff was polite, responsive and super kind to the “inmate”.

this is the longest ta review i probably will ever write. read on and you’ll find out why. hong kong's strict covid protocols required me to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine upon my arrival from the us two weeks ago. for many weeks before departure, i carefully weighed many options based on personal experience and knowledge along with feedback from other ""quarantineers"".  in the end, my experience at lanson place proved i could not have made a better choice. if you think about it, a quarantine stay tests a hotel more than any other type of visit. you are literally in the room and fully dependent on the hotel's ""hardware and software"" for two weeks, and lanson place was such a great experience on all levels that i actually enojyed the lock up! someone on a facebook quarantine support group asked how difficult it was to be cooped up for 14 days, and my response was lanson was such a serene pleasure that i would consider making it a two week retreat annually. the personal touches and care began before check in. the hotel’s team worked with me to ensure my reservation would be coordinated with my somewhat unpredictable arrival date due to testing and other covid formalities upon arrival into hk. they were flexible and accommodating and put my mind at ease.  and they saved my return when i was not being allowed to check in for my flight because my reservation did not include my middle name, and a lanson rep back in hk immediately emailed me a new one in the middle of the night hk time.  i was allowed to board, enjoyed my rather empty flight, passed my testing protocols at hk airport, and happily arrived back in town at lanson place the next day.lanson place may not have the brand recognition of some of the more well known luxury hotel brands, but the vibe and ambience is very similar. you get a sense of intimacy and good taste upon arrival. the feel is that you've been welcomed into a tasteful residence rather than a hotel. the hotel’s rooms manager took time to personally greet me and commiserate a bit about the challenges we all face with covid.  she assured me they’d be at the ready for anything i’d need during my incarceration, including sending the staff out for any incidentals and groceries i might require. i usually do not book suites but given the nature of this stay, i thought springing for the additional space would be some of the best money i could spend during a year when i had virtually no travel expenses. it was a good decision. the prestige suite had the feel of a smartly designed one bedroom residence and was great value.  both the living area (which was spacious enough for my yoga and golf putting matts) and bedroom (which had wonderfully comfortable bedding) were spacious and well laid out. floor to ceiling windows provided wonderful natural light that really created a welcome openness during the long stay.  the kitchenette, which included a nespresso machine  (something i cannot live without),  was well equipped and more than satisfactory for food prep i did myself when not ordering from the hotel or calling in uber eats which were delivered promptly by the front desk staff.  the avocado toast on the breakfast menu became a highlight i’d look forward to each day.  the hotel generously kept me regularly supplied with an array of nespresso pods. the tv service was excellent. they have not scrimped on paying for global networks and provide a full array of the best names in cable/satellite tv along with the ability to mirror your laptop to the screens for viewing streaming services. wifi coverage was strong and stable and service included multiple devices. i don’t think i had a signal drop the entire stay. it was great as i worked for weeks from the large, well equipped desk.the staff was polite, responsive and super kind to the “inmate”.  i got the sense they knew the challenges of quarantine and were extending extra kindness to make the experience easier and more pleasant.  in all, from booking to exit when i took my first breath of fresh air in two weeks, the experience could not have been better. i’m very grateful for everything the management and staff at lanson place did to help me through the most unique stay of my 40 years of travel.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,,

My friend who stayed in Ovolo Central for quarantine recommended Ovolo to me. I chose The Sheung Wan by Ovolo simply because it’s near my sister’s house. I was glad that I made the right decision because of their friendly, and dedicating services!I flew by myself to HK, and I just needed a comfortable place to stay, and work remotely during the mandatory quarantine. Therefore, I booked the Snug Room (1 queen size bed; approx. 130-150 sq.ft.). The room was perfect for me with a desk to work, and a big window to get vitamin D, and to relax my eyes from work. The room was not big but I could still stretch myself, and reach the requirement of taking 3000 steps per day on my fitness app. It’s quiet at night so I could watch the Netflix movies through the Apple TV the hotel provided relaxingly.The bathroom was pretty decent - clean, bright, and good water pressure (glad to have a rain shower head too). They offered CLEAN PRODUCTS - shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand wash and lotion were free from paraben, mineral oil, artificial colorant, artificial fragrance, and more importantly no animal testing. The housekeepers refilled toilet rolls, facial tissues and trash bags almost every day. These could be requested if needed more. The housekeeping services were brilliant!The package included unlimited refill of bottled water, brekkie, and a welcome treat in fridge. They offered three options of breakfast plus a cup of coffee (cappuccino/ latte etc.), an orange juice, and an apple. I really appreciated that the containers, and utensils the hotel used were biodegradable. Thanks for caring and loving the earth! I happened to have a meal from the hotel’s restaurant “Te Quiero Mucho”, where the breakfast were provided too. I love Mexican food in LA, and I could say their Mexican food was delicious! The food network around the hotel was great! I ordered food through the app Deliveroo, which offered  many choices of different restaurants with different cuisines. They delivered food promptly after checking in with the hotel reception. You wouldn’t be starved because of a great hotel restaurant, and a great food network there!I received some treats on the last week of my quarantine. Even though the treats were just some drinks and snacks, they still made my day after being forced to stay in a room for so long. The area manager, Sonesh, contacted me to check out my condition and feeling of the stay, and offered a fitness kit to me after emailing regarding my reason of making the decision of staying in this hotel. I was amazed. The reception/front desk staff (Aki, Renee, Joe, and Wally) I contacted with through WhatsApp and in-room phone calls were very friendly and helpful. I could tell my experience in The Sheung Wan by Ovolo was brilliant because of the excellent customer services and hospitality from this professional team!

There was an apology email sent by the guest relations after check out regarding midnight noise disturbance was nice; however I replied with some compliments for staff and also numerous hardware issues/incident occurred during the stay and unbelievably there was still no reply or apology email after so many months. I had almost forgotten about this until my partner reminds me of this incident when we are discussing where to go for staycation again and the refreshed bad taste memories encouraged me to write on Tripadvisor. Honestly, if a customer replied with so many hardware issues occurred during his stay, your guest relations should have at least replied an extra apology email instead of turning a blind eye towards the complaint email especially when your guest holds a suite booking and paying rates close to rack rate.So..here's what happened:1. Lunch at Kitchen / Room ServiceOne of the glass containers for the cold cut was found severely chipped and almost cut my friend's wife's finger but fortunately she was fine. Also, a piece of foreign object was found in the stewed soup and such was commented to one of your staff. I would like to praise your restaurant manager Roger's professionalism for proactively meeting us at the table to apologize and unexpectedly offering us a round of orange juice/coffee as a gesture of goodwill. I also want to extend my compliments for the room service ribeye steak I ordered and it was beautifully cooked!2. Check-in / Check OutI had made a request for an early check-in at noon but I understand your rooms might not be available so I eventually approached the counter at 3:30pm. I was warmly welcomed by Stephanie and impressed by her hospitality skills. Despite I was disappointed by the fact that the room wasn't available at that moment and no estimated time can be given, Stephanie looked into my needs and offered complimentary overnight parking as a service recovery which counteracted my disappointment. Stephanie was kind enough to note down my mobile number and offered to call me back when the room is ready but I returned and got my room before she called. I met Brian at check-out and he sincerely apologized about the midnight noise disturbance issue which I fully understand was not his fault nor the hotel's fault. Kudos to Stephanie and Brian for their warm hospitality.3. Room ConditionOne of the ceiling spotlights was fused upon check-in but this was swiftly taken care of by your engineering team after I informed reception before going out. However, some black pieces of plastic debris were found on the carpet after the maintenance and this is is a bit unexpected for not calling housekeeping to perform a quick vacuum after the work. To be honest I was expecting the room to be more modernized and at least equipped with AirPlay ready speakers. The bluetooth dongle didn't work (bluetooth successfully connected according to my device but no sound from the speaker; eventually unplug the 3.5mm jack from the dongle and plug it directly to my Macbook to make it work) and the living room TV was in low definition quality while the TV speaker was not fully functional (muted by itself all of a sudden and had to restart the TV a couple of times). Bathtub was not in great condition and had a patch of black spot which was not removable by rubbing against it by finger. The TV facing the bathtub was not operational and unable to change to any other channels other than the hotel page. HDMI cable was all loaned out but I understand this was due to your high occupancy situation. However, I would suggest your management pre-set a HDMI cable in each room or even upgrade to Miracast/Airplay system instead of placing the out-dated LAN cable which almost every devices supports Wi-Fi nowadays. It was a nice touch to have a Nespresso coffee maker in the room with to-go cups ready however it seemed to be faulty as well when I attempted to grab a quick coffee before checking out. I know how’s the usual portion when pressing the ""large cup"" button but the portion generated by that particular machine in Rm 3001 was barely enough to half-fill up a normal espresso cup. Despite all the said issues, I must praise the quality of the linens used as they are silky smooth and the duvet are in perfect thickness.Will I stay again in W HK for staycation? I'm not sure.

however i replied with some compliments for staff and also numerous hardware issues/incident occurred during the stay and unbelievably there was still no reply or apology email after so many months. i had almost forgotten about this until my partner reminds me of this incident when we are discussing where to go for staycation again and the refreshed bad taste memories encouraged me to write on tripadvisor. honestly, if a customer replied with so many hardware issues occurred during his stay, your guest relations should have at least replied an extra apology email instead of turning a blind eye towards the complaint email especially when your guest holds a suite booking and paying rates close to rack rate.so..here's what happened:1. lunch at kitchen / room serviceone of the glass containers for the cold cut was found severely chipped and almost cut my friend's wife's finger but fortunately she was fine. also, a piece of foreign object was found in the stewed soup and such was commented to one of your staff. i would like to praise your restaurant manager roger's professionalism for proactively meeting us at the table to apologize and unexpectedly offering us a round of orange juice/coffee as a gesture of goodwill. i also want to extend my compliments for the room service ribeye steak i ordered and it was beautifully cooked!2. check-in / check outi had made a request for an early check-in at noon but i understand your rooms might not be available so i eventually approached the counter at 3:30pm. i was warmly welcomed by stephanie and impressed by her hospitality skills. despite i was disappointed by the fact that the room wasn't available at that moment and no estimated time can be given, stephanie looked into my needs and offered complimentary overnight parking as a service recovery which counteracted my disappointment. stephanie was kind enough to note down my mobile number and offered to call me back when the room is ready but i returned and got my room before she called. i met brian at check-out and he sincerely apologized about the midnight noise disturbance issue which i fully understand was not his fault nor the hotel's fault. kudos to stephanie and brian for their warm hospitality.3. room conditionone of the ceiling spotlights was fused upon check-in but this was swiftly taken care of by your engineering team after i informed reception before going out. however, some black pieces of plastic debris were found on the carpet after the maintenance and this is is a bit unexpected for not calling housekeeping to perform a quick vacuum after the work. to be honest i was expecting the room to be more modernized and at least equipped with airplay ready speakers. the bluetooth dongle didn't work (bluetooth successfully connected according to my device but no sound from the speaker; eventually unplug the 3.5mm jack from the dongle and plug it directly to my macbook to make it work) and the living room tv was in low definition quality while the tv speaker was not fully functional (muted by itself all of a sudden and had to restart the tv a couple of times). bathtub was not in great condition and had a patch of black spot which was not removable by rubbing against it by finger. the tv facing the bathtub was not operational and unable to change to any other channels other than the hotel page. hdmi cable was all loaned out but i understand this was due to your high occupancy situation. however, i would suggest your management pre-set a hdmi cable in each room or even upgrade to miracast/airplay system instead of placing the out-dated lan cable which almost every devices supports wi-fi nowadays. it was a nice touch to have a nespresso coffee maker in the room with to-go cups ready however it seemed to be faulty as well when i attempted to grab a quick coffee before checking out. i know how’s the usual portion when pressing the ""large cup"" button but the portion generated by that particular machine in rm 3001 was barely enough to half-fill up a normal espresso cup. despite all the said issues, i must praise the quality of the linens used as they are silky smooth and the duvet are in perfect thickness.will i stay again in w hk for staycation? i'm not sure. i was recommended by friends and was disappointed with the hardware to be honest. however, i can tell you the new sheraton in tung chung which i stayed in early december (around 5 days before the property being transformed into a quarantine hotel) was a much better option.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

The only available room was the standard room which is small but clean.  It has enough supply for 14 days except we ran out of bottled water in the last couple of days.   However, the meals are mostly terrible.  For example breakfast with two mini Chinese buns are not edible since they are hard, more than day old which should be tossed not served.   One time beef brisket was served but was so tough that we ended up having the sauce with rice.  After the first week, boxed drinks were no longer served with meals.  When we get fruit with meal, the apples are almost rotten.  We feel like we are prisoners at your mercy during the stay, not like a guest.   No one answered the phone at the front desk unless I kept trying for a few times.  But when I got through, I really appreciate their efforts especially Gabriel.  On the day of checkout, we were so frustrated.  We had confirmed the arrangement with front desk that we will be out by 10 a.m.   When we called them to let us out, obviously we could not get through as usual.  After trying a few times, we finally got through and was told there would be delay of 15-30 minutes since they were checking people in.  We patiently wait 30 minutes then 30 minutes more....  By about 12 noon I called and told them we were supposed to meet a group of people at 12 noon and they would be waiting.  So finally by 12 noon we checked out which only took 5 minutes.  Wish they would let us out first instead of checking several people in and wasted 2 hours of our time.  Overall it could have been a better stay if the management could be more sympathetic to guests who need to be quarantined.  The last quarantine hotel  (Metropark) we had stayed was much better but it was not available.  I read the reviews about your hotel from Tripadvisor and was expecting an unpleasant stay.  Sadly to say, they are right.  I understand that this is a difficult situation but treating the guests nicely and humanely could make such a difference.  We are not picky eaters but when meals are prepared so sloppily it is humiliating and ruined the hotel's reputation as well.

Sport, Yoga and working on my Thesis helped me a lot, while I have also deepened my language skills with duolingo in French, called many friends and my family and wrote a to do list I was able to finish (things like sort out pictures an contacts on the phone, call old friends, draw an idea of a project I want to start in December and so on).

The rooms of the hotel have helped to stay happy, as these rooms are very bright, mainly keept simple and in white and had huge windows (sadly not possible to open). The roomservice was good as well.

The receptionists were always very friendly and have tried to do their best to make my stay comfortable!The food was most of the time good! I have had the vegetarian option. It felt like it repeated itself in a 3-5 day cycle, but this could also be me, as I am not used to have asian cusine all the time. Only one time I was unhappy, as I have ordered a grouper from the menu twice. The first time it was really delivious, pan seared, fresh and also the veggies were seasoned great! So I decided to order it again 4 days later but then I was very jnsatisfied as it was covered in dough, soaky and the veggies weren’t cooked through.

My original reservation was for 14-days, but the government suddenly put my origin into Group A, so I have to stay for 21 days. The reservation department responded swiftly to accommodate my need.  The room is big with big window, which is essential for such a long stay without being able to leave the room. The cleaning package and the snacks reflect the thoughtfulness of the hotel staff. The food is good, includes traditional Canton and western cuisines and random afternoon teas as rewards.

A couple of warnings about the bathroom - the bathroom is in poor condition. The shower room is tiny and the shower head is old and water does not come out of all nozzles. There is also no handheld shower hose available. The shower drain can’t tolerate bigger water flow as it is kind of clogged. The area under the bathroom sink was extremely dirty, as if it’s never been cleaned. The faucet in the bathroom sink points water right at the edge of basin, such that my hands constantly hit the edge of the basin while trying to wash my hands and water inevitably splashes out of the basin. Upon entering the room, I also noticed that the corners of the room were dusty. Edges of the table were dusty as well, which I ended up cleaning myself. The lack of cleanliness of the room is all very puzzling given this is a quarantine hotel. When I arrived in the room, I was also surprised to find two queen sized beds, although I am quarantining solo, and I had requested one bed. Once you enter a quarantine room, it’s quite hard to change unless you inform the health department. What a pity that they advertise a certain size to a room but don’t tell you that a chunk of the floor area would be occupied by an additional bed. A big frustration with the hotel is what appears to be a shortage of staff. My food deliveries from Deliveroo/Foodpanda takes in between 35 minutes to well over 1 hour to get to my room from just the front the desk of the hotel. So, a hot meal from any nearby restaurant is just not an option. When anything is delivered to the room, such as meals, they’re left on the table in front of the room door. To alert the hotel guest, the hotel staff rings the doorbell, while the guest waits a while before getting the food in order to avoid contact with anyone. Instead of ringing the doorbell once, as a reasonable person might do, hotel staff has the tendency to ring the doorbell 2 or 3 or 4 times accompanied by a knock or a bang. This is quite embarrassing or disruptive if I happen to be on a phone/work call and it’s rather alarming if resting or sleeping. There are a lot of things that are very positive about the room though that I think help even out the negatives mentioned above. The room’s harbor view and the large windows make all the difference during quarantine stay and make the room feel bigger. The hotel provides the option to rent a stationary bike which is very helpful. The ceilings are relatively high and helps with not feeling claustrophobic. The room also provides an air purifier. The operators that answer the hotel phone are friendly and they are responsive, even if it takes them a while to fulfill a request. The room rate is very reasonable as compared to other hotels.  The room’s wooden floors are a positive in the sense that it’s easier to clean than carpet especially as there is no housekeeping for weeks, but at the same time there are constant sounds of chairs scraping against the floor from neighbors.",0,,,"nice harbor view, inconsistent service, cleanliness is an issue this hotel opened up for quarantine on 1 december 2021, and i should be the first batch of quarantine guests in nina hotel tsuen wan west. a couple of warnings about the bathroom - the bathroom is in poor condition. the shower room is tiny and the shower head is old and water does not come out of all nozzles. there is also no handheld shower hose available. the shower drain can’t tolerate bigger water flow as it is kind of clogged. the area under the bathroom sink was extremely dirty, as if it’s never been cleaned. the faucet in the bathroom sink points water right at the edge of basin, such that my hands constantly hit the edge of the basin while trying to wash my hands and water inevitably splashes out of the basin. upon entering the room, i also noticed that the corners of the room were dusty. edges of the table were dusty as well, which i ended up cleaning myself. the lack of cleanliness of the room is all very puzzling given this is a quarantine hotel. when i arrived in the room, i was also surprised to find two queen sized beds, although i am quarantining solo, and i had requested one bed. once you enter a quarantine room, it’s quite hard to change unless you inform the health department. what a pity that they advertise a certain size to a room but don’t tell you that a chunk of the floor area would be occupied by an additional bed. a big frustration with the hotel is what appears to be a shortage of staff. my food deliveries from deliveroo/foodpanda takes in between 35 minutes to well over 1 hour to get to my room from just the front the desk of the hotel. so, a hot meal from any nearby restaurant is just not an option. when anything is delivered to the room, such as meals, they’re left on the table in front of the room door. to alert the hotel guest, the hotel staff rings the doorbell, while the guest waits a while before getting the food in order to avoid contact with anyone. instead of ringing the doorbell once, as a reasonable person might do, hotel staff has the tendency to ring the doorbell 2 or 3 or 4 times accompanied by a knock or a bang. this is quite embarrassing or disruptive if i happen to be on a phone/work call and it’s rather alarming if resting or sleeping. there are a lot of things that are very positive about the room though that i think help even out the negatives mentioned above. the room’s harbor view and the large windows make all the difference during quarantine stay and make the room feel bigger. the hotel provides the option to rent a stationary bike which is very helpful. the ceilings are relatively high and helps with not feeling claustrophobic. the room also provides an air purifier. the operators that answer the hotel phone are friendly and they are responsive, even if it takes them a while to fulfill a request. the room rate is very reasonable as compared to other hotels.  the room’s wooden floors are a positive in the sense that it’s easier to clean than carpet especially as there is no housekeeping for weeks, but at the same time there are constant sounds of chairs scraping against the floor from neighbors.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,,

After a 12-hour flight from London to HK, and a 7-hour stint at the airport (getting tested, waiting for results etc.) by the time I was taken to the hotel it had been more than 24 hours since I had last seen a bed. Everything went smoothly at check in. My first impression of the hotel staff was that they were very efficient. The hotel runs like a well-oiled machine. They’ve been a quarantine hotel for months and it shows. The staff are very well prepared. Check in was quick and all the guests were kept at a safe distance from each other. After check in, they get an elevator for you and ask you to go straight to your room. Once you’re in, you can’t leave for 21 days unless you test positive or if there’s an emergency. The hotel (not the room) does smell a tiny bit like a hospital. I think it’s because they had to regularly sanitize the place. I actually found that quite reassuring. It made me feel safe. Now food - after reading so many horror stories about quarantine hotel food, I had very low expectations. Meals are delivered to your room every day around 8am, noon, 7pm. They were mostly delivered on time. I was told that sometimes there might be delays because of new arrivals or if they were still doing tests. I know they can’t deliver food unless the whole floor is clear. I’d say the food is like what you’d get at a university canteen. Nothing to write home about but definitely edible. For lunch and dinner it’s usually a meat dish and some veggies. It usually comes with plain rice. What I liked was that I was given the menu for the whole 21 days. So I knew what was coming. And if I knew I wouldn’t like what was on the menu I could also order delivery, which I did a few times to treat myself (Food Panda and Deliveroo both worked). They delivered the food to my room soon after it arrived. Considering this is quite a big hotel and probably many people order delivery around meal times, I was quite impressed. The room was generally clean and spacious. You get all the basic amenities, change of bedding, lots of towels, toothbrush, shampoo/shower gel, even laundry power. You get 25 bottles of water for the whole stay. But of course there’s a kettle for you to boil water for drinking. I ended up not finishing all the bottled water. There’s a big flatscreen TV with lots of international channels. The WiFi was adequate. It wasn’t lightning speed but I never had any problem connecting to the internet. Netflix, YouTube worked fine.

The room size was great for the price while the food was average. It's good that they provide you with the full menu of your stay but breakfast is very repetitive rotating between 3 different selections. Most lunch and dinner was mostly different variations of rice. No noodles, no pasta or any other selections. The internet was horrible while the connection often drops and the speed is extremely slow. I DO NOT RECOMMEND if you need to work during your stay or if you plan to stream and videos. I ended up tethering from my mobile and exceeding my data usage and topping up with my provider as I would often get disconnected during work calls. There was also renovations in the hotel which was quite noisy and one of the days there was no water for half the day and another day there was no toilet water for more than 7 hours so the smell was really bad. Calling reception was difficult as well as I've called reception 3 times and none of which I would get through on my first try. I'd have to try several times over 15 minute time frames. There was no customer service as my previous hotel stay would have someone call up every couple of days to ask if I needed any refills. This hotel only provided 24 water bottles (with norefill allowed) and coffee and tea bags. No soft drinks (unlike other hotels) or anything else. I ordered food panda a total of 4 times. 1 was for panda mart where I ordered some drinks and snacks and the delivery to my room was quick. Other 3 times were for meals and I needed to wait almost an hour some foodpanda dropping off my food for it to arrive at my door. They have only specific time frames that they will deliver food up but this was really slow as 1 time i ordered a soup noodle but the restaurant didn't separate the soup and noodles so when it arrived to my room, it was not very edible. Lastly, there was only 1 outlet available near the desk and 1 more near the window so there was a lack of outlets that could be used for charging devices or laptop. I've stayed here 1 night before when I had a mandatory quarantine over a year ago since my flight landed after 4pm and I need to wait for my results. The internet wasn't good then, but I still booked this hotel thinking a year later, this would be improved. So because of the room size and it's not too far from my home, I gave it another try.

We were travelling as a family of three from Australia to Hong Kong. The strict travelling restriction had made us hesitate before committing on the journey and obviously the 14 days hotel quarantine was one of our major concerns. We did many researches and finally settled on the Regal Oriental because of its price, close proximity to our home and most importantly, the staff at the hotel had given us some assurance that we would be in good hands during our 14 days confinement at the hotel.Before we experienced it ourselves, much information gathered about the details of the quarantine experiences was from social media and online forums, and naturally they vary greatly from post to post. Once we had shortlisted a couple of the hotels that we were interested in, we started to contact with them. Among them Regal Oriental was the first to get back to us with not only the essential information about the hotel, but also what to expect once we have landed in Hong Kong and during our quarantine. We cannot thank Eric Yu the assistant operation manager enough to give us some really helpful tips to make our travelling experience a lot more pleasant – through email we have expressed our concern of travelling as an active family with a young child, and Eric had insightfully suggested we booked a flight that arrived in the early morning to minimize the wait for the Covid test result at the airport, also he suggested that we can bring along a couple of the yoga mats as well as a laptop with HDMI cable to connect with the in-room TV so we can keep our body active with online exercise programs.Upon on our arrival at the hotel the staff at the Regal Oriental explained the quarantine rules to us clearly while managed to check us in swiftly, carefully sanitized our suitcases and the lift and then we were let into our room.The room we stayed in was spacious by Hong Kong standard. It was clean and comfortable with an open view overlooking the construction site of Kai Tak Sports Park. Luckily the sound insulation of their double windows was good it was not noisy at all (actually we could barely hear any noise from the other residents neither). There’s also a sizeable desk for work. We moved our two large beds to one side to create a space large enough to lay our yoga mats for exercise. The bathroom was clean with a bathtub, a rain shower and plenty of clean towels.I remembered reading some complaints on social media about the in-room Wi-Fi only adequate for casual browsing. However, we found the speed was totally acceptable for our online meetings as well as streaming online exercise videos throughout our stay - perhaps we were used to the mediocre internet speed back in Australia!Three meals a day were provided with menus on rotation. The breakfast was basic. Lunch and dinner were simple Chinese/ Hong Kong style cuisine usually served with soup, a piece of fruit, salad (raw fresh veg) and dessert. There were also other options to suit different dietary requirements, and I had ordered Indian Halal diet simply for the love of Indian cuisine. Meals were far from delicacy but we all found the ingredients were always in good quality and the most importantly fresh. For those who are curious about what to do during quarantine, our daily routine was basically comprised of exercises, meal time, online meeting with friends and colleagues, work (on computers), playing guitar, watching TV, playing (board) games and to everyone surprises, 14 days passed quite pleasantly. We feel very blessed that the whole time we spent at Regal Oriental we felt very well looked after, safe and relaxed. We thought hotel quarantine could never be a pleasant experience. However, by picking a suitable hotel and with a right attitude (plus a little bit of luck) I believe we have made the best out of this once in a lifetime experience.",0,,,"made the best from our quarantine stay i generally don't write any review on hotels but after spending our 14 days in regal oriental hotel, i feel obliged to share our quarantine experience. we were travelling as a family of three from australia to hong kong. the strict travelling restriction had made us hesitate before committing on the journey and obviously the 14 days hotel quarantine was one of our major concerns. we did many researches and finally settled on the regal oriental because of its price, close proximity to our home and most importantly, the staff at the hotel had given us some assurance that we would be in good hands during our 14 days confinement at the hotel.before we experienced it ourselves, much information gathered about the details of the quarantine experiences was from social media and online forums, and naturally they vary greatly from post to post. once we had shortlisted a couple of the hotels that we were interested in, we started to contact with them. among them regal oriental was the first to get back to us with not only the essential information about the hotel, but also what to expect once we have landed in hong kong and during our quarantine. we cannot thank eric yu the assistant operation manager enough to give us some really helpful tips to make our travelling experience a lot more pleasant – through email we have expressed our concern of travelling as an active family with a young child, and eric had insightfully suggested we booked a flight that arrived in the early morning to minimize the wait for the covid test result at the airport, also he suggested that we can bring along a couple of the yoga mats as well as a laptop with hdmi cable to connect with the in-room tv so we can keep our body active with online exercise programs.upon on our arrival at the hotel the staff at the regal oriental explained the quarantine rules to us clearly while managed to check us in swiftly, carefully sanitized our suitcases and the lift and then we were let into our room.the room we stayed in was spacious by hong kong standard. it was clean and comfortable with an open view overlooking the construction site of kai tak sports park. luckily the sound insulation of their double windows was good it was not noisy at all (actually we could barely hear any noise from the other residents neither). there’s also a sizeable desk for work. we moved our two large beds to one side to create a space large enough to lay our yoga mats for exercise. the bathroom was clean with a bathtub, a rain shower and plenty of clean towels.i remembered reading some complaints on social media about the in-room wi-fi only adequate for casual browsing. however, we found the speed was totally acceptable for our online meetings as well as streaming online exercise videos throughout our stay - perhaps we were used to the mediocre internet speed back in australia!three meals a day were provided with menus on rotation. the breakfast was basic. lunch and dinner were simple chinese/ hong kong style cuisine usually served with soup, a piece of fruit, salad (raw fresh veg) and dessert. there were also other options to suit different dietary requirements, and i had ordered indian halal diet simply for the love of indian cuisine. meals were far from delicacy but we all found the ingredients were always in good quality and the most importantly fresh. for those who are curious about what to do during quarantine, our daily routine was basically comprised of exercises, meal time, online meeting with friends and colleagues, work (on computers), playing guitar, watching tv, playing (board) games and to everyone surprises, 14 days passed quite pleasantly. we feel very blessed that the whole time we spent at regal oriental we felt very well looked after, safe and relaxed. we thought hotel quarantine could never be a pleasant experience. however, by picking a suitable hotel and with a right attitude (plus a little bit of luck) i believe we have made the best out of this once in a lifetime experience.",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

I got pretty good service - I had asked friends and family to bring me stuff and everything came reasonably quickly. They have a whole hotel to service and so many things to do (e.g. COVID testing, cleaning, delivering meals, intake of new guests) -- I thought it made sense that these deliveries had a relatively low priority. The staff were polite and helpful. It was pretty quiet all day which some people may find a bit creepy but I found it relaxing. The only noise I heard was staff cleaning the hallways and doors 1-2x per day and knocking on my door when my meals/stuff were delivered or to do COVID testing. Wi-fi was good - I was able to stream most YouTube videos easily and attend virtual meetings. This is KEY because I heard a lot of the other hotels at the same price point had very weak signal.The meals were ok but come on, we're quarantining - not looking for luxury meals. I thought it was comparable to an average cha chaan teng or dai paai dong restaurant in HK (not like really good ones, but just plain average). Way too much rice though, which I got sick of and had to throw out lots of because I could never finish it. Wish there was an option for smaller meals. (By the way, beware of lots of string beans in 70% of the meals.) The windows were really big and I got good natural lighting but I didn't get the greatest view  and I couldn't open the windows as they seemed purposely locked.  Overall, if I was forced to quarantine again, I would consider coming back. It was a pretty good deal for such a cheap price compared to many of the other hotels.

Word on the street was that neither hotels were candidates for any hotel awards. However, I was simply relieved that I could get a hotel booking. To prepare myself, I watched a lot of prison movies but it was honestly not as bad as I expected. The standard Regal Oriental room is sizeable with two queen-sized beds, space to exercise and I had a glorious open view of a building site. The staff were friendly and I had running hot water.  There were, however, a few negatives - the room was not very clean and felt muggy, windows were bolted shut with no fresh air and the ventilation system was poor. The food was not very appetizing, it was pretty much the same veg + meat in dark sauce + a lot of rice for lunch and dinner every day, so if you are allergic to rice then you might have a problem. Thankfully, one could order takeaways from outside but the average wait time from delivery to the hotel to my room was 60 minutes, which was often frustrating.

Please DO NOT book!My name is Trikaansh and I decided to book my stay for 21Nights at Regal Oriental Kowloon. Hong Kong government has implemented a mandatory quarantine of 21Nights when you arrive in Hong Kong from any part of the world. They have selected 36 Designated Hotel from which one can choose to stay. I booked my stay from the 14th January 2021 to 4th February 2021. So when I was trying to book a hotel, I literally had only 2 hotel room options to choose from as most of the hotels were booked and were not taking any new reservations. Amongst the two hotel options I had I choose Regal Oriental Kowloon because it is near to my home in Hong Kong and my sister and my mum can drop some food in the evening for me.When I first arrived which was 4:35pm on the 14th January. I had to carry my luggage to the reception and back to the room and yes I did have a lot of luggage with me so there was no belly boy. I had paid almost 19,000 HKD, yes it’s a lot but I didn’t have any choice the other hotel room was 20,000 HKD so I choose Regal Kowloon Oriental. Both of the amount was including 3 Vegetarian Meal (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner). So in the next paragraphs you will get to know how they treated me.At the time of check in, I had mentioned specifically to the receptionist that I am a vegetarian person and I do not eat any egg, meat, or fish products and I am allergic to Mushrooms and Egg Plant. I had also mentioned I follow Buddhism and they (Chuck and Eric at the reception) nodded, gave me a Menu Card for Vegetarian and gave me the key to the room. I somehow pulled my bags to the lift and back to the room without any trolley and no one helped me. When I entered the room, it was not cleaned properly there was dust everywhere (on the carpet, the mirror was dirty, bed had dust on it,etc), the Hot water Kettle was not working, TV channels were not working and then I called the receptionist to inform about the above and they said we cannot do anything once you are in the room. My reaction was like how am I supposed to do so much of cleaning and I was tired so I didn’t have the energy to fight back so I said ok and told them to send  a new kettle. After telling them that the kettle is not working they are arguing and telling me that it was working fine before you entered the room and I was like what the hell?! Hello it’s not my problem it’s your issue and after the argument they sent another kettle and honestly the kettle was not in a good condition even the replaced one but I left the conversation right there and I cleaned the bed and slept for some time. As I had not eaten any breakfast or lunch I told them to give me lunch even then they started arguing that it’s not the time for lunch and I told them it’s not my problem that I came now I was just following the Hong Kong government guidelines and procedure as I was dropped by the airport bus which took almost 3 hours to drop me to the hotel. Finally they decided to give me lunch and it was terrible, they gave me some type of Noodles and  it had mushrooms,eggplant and egg white I informed the hotel about the food and I really didn’t have any energy and I went back to sleep. Next day morning when the breakfast arrived at 9:10am they gave me 1 croissant, 1 Bun and raw egg. I complained again to the restaurant and they replied with sorry sir we will inform the restaurant and they never sent a replacement for the food. All this while I took a lot of photos for evidence. This happened almost every alternative day and I was helpless, so I told my sister to bring some food and drop it at the reception and they will deliver it to me. The receptionist told me that my family should send the food by 7 and we will send it by 8:30pm and this happened for almost 8-10days everyday and my sister got really angry and told the receptionist to deliver the food immediately when she delivered as the food used to get cold because of the weather. They still used to send the food as per their convenience. This is how I was surviving through my stay. The hotel was so cheap minded and when I asked for water they said they have already given me 14bottles and now they will charge $10 per bottle I order them I argued and reminded them that I am here to stay for 21Nights and not for 2nights well when I had checked in they told me they have given water enough for 7 days if I want more I just have to call and ask and they will send also I never ate the hotel food as it was always mixed with some Non Veg product, After 8-10days one morning when I was using the washroom the wall tiles behind me came out they were about to fall on me luckily nothing that kind happened. I informed the receptionist and they took it lightly and hung up on me, so I told my sister to inform the hotel manager about this, by the way I have all the photos for evidence. After she argued for almost a day the hotel finally decide to change my room. So I again had to pack my things and move my baggage by myself to the other room. The new room was dirty and filled with dust. The table was filled with dirt and dust but yes it was better than the room I had before in terms of standard of living. Here the phone was not working as I am in quarantine and I cannot go out so I told my sister to inform the manager and she sent someone to check and it was not working properly and she fixed it for me. After all this on the 16th or 17th day when my sister sent some food they threw it outside of my room and inside of the bag everything fell and there was soup inside so all my food was in soup and I couldn’t eat anything. One the staff removed my food from the bag and kept it in a laundry bag all this happened while I was in the room. When I came outside I thought someone had put rubbish in-front of the room then I realised that it was my dinner and I have taken photos and informed my sister about this and she called the manager and he tells my sister that you gave the food like that and she replied you can check the camera recordings as I made sure everything was packed properly until I delivered after then this happened. I was so frustrated with this situation I called the hotel receptionist and explained the situation and I could here they were laughing while I was complaining. I was so sad and depressed more than that helpless so I called the police they noted my complain but didn’t do much as they said it’s hotel internal matter and left me out to dry like that.

i want to share my experience in this pandemic to all of the people who are planning to book their quarantine stay at “regal oriental kowloon”. please do not book!my name is trikaansh and i decided to book my stay for 21nights at regal oriental kowloon. hong kong government has implemented a mandatory quarantine of 21nights when you arrive in hong kong from any part of the world. they have selected 36 designated hotel from which one can choose to stay. i booked my stay from the 14th january 2021 to 4th february 2021. so when i was trying to book a hotel, i literally had only 2 hotel room options to choose from as most of the hotels were booked and were not taking any new reservations. amongst the two hotel options i had i choose regal oriental kowloon because it is near to my home in hong kong and my sister and my mum can drop some food in the evening for me.when i first arrived which was 4:35pm on the 14th january. i had to carry my luggage to the reception and back to the room and yes i did have a lot of luggage with me so there was no belly boy. i had paid almost 19,000 hkd, yes it’s a lot but i didn’t have any choice the other hotel room was 20,000 hkd so i choose regal kowloon oriental. both of the amount was including 3 vegetarian meal (breakfast + lunch + dinner). so in the next paragraphs you will get to know how they treated me.at the time of check in, i had mentioned specifically to the receptionist that i am a vegetarian person and i do not eat any egg, meat, or fish products and i am allergic to mushrooms and egg plant. i had also mentioned i follow buddhism and they (chuck and eric at the reception) nodded, gave me a menu card for vegetarian and gave me the key to the room. i somehow pulled my bags to the lift and back to the room without any trolley and no one helped me. when i entered the room, it was not cleaned properly there was dust everywhere (on the carpet, the mirror was dirty, bed had dust on it,etc), the hot water kettle was not working, tv channels were not working and then i called the receptionist to inform about the above and they said we cannot do anything once you are in the room. my reaction was like how am i supposed to do so much of cleaning and i was tired so i didn’t have the energy to fight back so i said ok and told them to send  a new kettle. after telling them that the kettle is not working they are arguing and telling me that it was working fine before you entered the room and i was like what the hell?! hello it’s not my problem it’s your issue and after the argument they sent another kettle and honestly the kettle was not in a good condition even the replaced one but i left the conversation right there and i cleaned the bed and slept for some time. as i had not eaten any breakfast or lunch i told them to give me lunch even then they started arguing that it’s not the time for lunch and i told them it’s not my problem that i came now i was just following the hong kong government guidelines and procedure as i was dropped by the airport bus which took almost 3 hours to drop me to the hotel. finally they decided to give me lunch and it was terrible, they gave me some type of noodles and  it had mushrooms,eggplant and egg white i informed the hotel about the food and i really didn’t have any energy and i went back to sleep. next day morning when the breakfast arrived at 9:10am they gave me 1 croissant, 1 bun and raw egg. i complained again to the restaurant and they replied with sorry sir we will inform the restaurant and they never sent a replacement for the food. all this while i took a lot of photos for evidence. this happened almost every alternative day and i was helpless, so i told my sister to bring some food and drop it at the reception and they will deliver it to me. the receptionist told me that my family should send the food by 7 and we will send it by 8:30pm and this happened for almost 8-10days everyday and my sister got really angry and told the receptionist to deliver the food immediately when she delivered as the food used to get cold because of the weather. they still used to send the food as per their convenience. this is how i was surviving through my stay. the hotel was so cheap minded and when i asked for water they said they have already given me 14bottles and now they will charge $10 per bottle i order them i argued and reminded them that i am here to stay for 21nights and not for 2nights well when i had checked in they told me they have given water enough for 7 days if i want more i just have to call and ask and they will send also i never ate the hotel food as it was always mixed with some non veg product, after 8-10days one morning when i was using the washroom the wall tiles behind me came out they were about to fall on me luckily nothing that kind happened. i informed the receptionist and they took it lightly and hung up on me, so i told my sister to inform the hotel manager about this, by the way i have all the photos for evidence. after she argued for almost a day the hotel finally decide to change my room. so i again had to pack my things and move my baggage by myself to the other room. the new room was dirty and filled with dust. the table was filled with dirt and dust but yes it was better than the room i had before in terms of standard of living. here the phone was not working as i am in quarantine and i cannot go out so i told my sister to inform the manager and she sent someone to check and it was not working properly and she fixed it for me. after all this on the 16th or 17th day when my sister sent some food they threw it outside of my room and inside of the bag everything fell and there was soup inside so all my food was in soup and i couldn’t eat anything. one the staff removed my food from the bag and kept it in a laundry bag all this happened while i was in the room. when i came outside i thought someone had put rubbish in-front of the room then i realised that it was my dinner and i have taken photos and informed my sister about this and she called the manager and he tells my sister that you gave the food like that and she replied you can check the camera recordings as i made sure everything was packed properly until i delivered after then this happened. i was so frustrated with this situation i called the hotel receptionist and explained the situation and i could here they were laughing while i was complaining. i was so sad and depressed more than that helpless so i called the police they noted my complain but didn’t do much as they said it’s hotel internal matter and left me out to dry like that. they gave hong kong hotel association number and told me to contact them. one more thing the new room which they gave me the bed was so hard that i couldn’t sleep properly at all. my whole experience of staying here was awful and i highly not recommend this hotel at all.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,

A result of infractions to 'home quarantine' rules and ineffective tracking gear, the government imposed a 3 week quarantine in designated hotels. I was caught off guard, the hotel I reserved wasn't part of the list. I had to book this one in a hurry. I knew this wasn't the fanciest but counted on usually good service in HK. It is a disappointment beyond my already lowered expectations. The key thing is a stay here is HKD33,000 for three weeks, or HKD1,571 e.g. 4 times the advertised price on daily rate basis. The service going with it most likely lower than when the hotel is operating under normal conditions. Of course some of it has to do with complying with the local Department of Health's directions, however I find the attitude speaks loudly about the management's desire for immediate profit over the ongoing reputation of the hotel. Consider the conditions : the website and the booking process does not make any mention of restrictions during stay, save for the fact 'guests' are meant to stay in their rooms at all times. Payment is in advance of arrival.  Upon checking in, guests are made to sign, obviously in a situation where no choice is available, to sign papers detailing how no food can be ordered from outside, no amenities exist, etc. 'Guests' can now be called 'confinees', as the instructions in the room refer to.Let me check off the good parts. The room is old  and tired but clean, so are the sheets, and the mattress is fine (I like firmer ones). Bathroom also clean, towels, shampoo and soap smells rather good. Hot water takes about 5 minutes to come on in the morning - but it does come. During the 'quarantine package'  stay, meals arrive in a plastic box 3 times a day, placed on a chair outside the door, before a loud knock is made on the door - movie style. Morning breakfast consists of 2 danishes and a  small brick of pseudo fruit juice. There is a  Coffee machine in the room but broken so have to rely on the water heater and powder coffee, in limited supply. Other meals start to repeat themselves on the 2nd day of stay, all HK style fried rice and some vegetables - not bad if you appreciate local food - that said each lunch and dinner can't cost more than HKD70 a piece, generously.During 3 weeks no laundry service exists - justified of course, yet there is nothing to hang clothes on. Entreaties to the hotel staff in changing this situation are replied with 'all the hotels are the same' and 'we cannot'. English is shaky, but that is another topic.Packages can only be given in person by outside members between 5 and 6pm. For a traveller like me having no one in HK, Amazon or other deliveries are not allowed either, even though it should be reasonably safer for any other member of the local population. Asking for a ceramic cup instead of paper cups that are the only utensils, I am referred to  the  'Department of Health'. My view is as I don't hand this back to the staff which might pose a risk to them, i can't see how to deny this logically. 'Amenities' :Wifi exists, a little patchy sometimes, video calls can be interrupted often. UTube generally works but can interrupt for a few minutes. During most of the day and night there is a low rumbling sound like idling motors, but may be HVAC resonating on the walls ( construction finish in HK buildings is generally poor, even in the fanciest of places, i notice). This gets annoying at night. Low frequency noise is not good for health either. So all in all, while I have no way to know what other hotels here are actually practicing however this one can't help but feel like being manipulated, gouged over price, stonewalled and being treated, while a paying client like, well, inmate, bar that inmates get to see the outside once a day generally. Promise I will never stay again here. I hope the conditions are better when things return to normal - for now I would definitely move out if I could.",1,"dear h8808ladavidc,on behalf of our entire team, we appreciate your taking the time to share with us your comments on our service.   your evaluation of our service and constructive comments is greatly appreciated as without such observations, our team would not be able to improve on its performance. first of all, i am appreciate on your complement to the cleanliness of the roomabout the coffee machine inside the room is not broken, it is suggest by department of health to cover it by not using during now;

The hotel was a last minute booking with just one room available. So here are the pros and cons on day 7:1. Service: Check in was smooth. Any food I order gets delivered promptly. Any complaints i raise are addressed promptly. Meal deliveries are timely.2. Food: I am getting quarantine food. Its edible about 60-70% of the time quite easily. The room service menu is very limited, but judging by the quality of the quarantine food, I have not ordered any room service, and cant say.3. Wifi and connection: Strongish.. i do face intermittent trouble on video calls sometimes, but the connection is smooth about 95% of the time, so its quite reliable. 4. Room: Tiny. I am supposedly in a 19 sq m room that doesnt feel like it. the table is long enough to accomodate two laptops. The chair is not a work chair, more like a stool with a small back. For long hours, its a disaster. Imagine neck and shoulder sprain every day.4. Furniture: Should probably be burnt. Its dated. I opened one bag when i arrived and kept it outside, thank goodness. However, my Rimowa suitcase went straight in the cupboard to give the room some semblance of space. Big mistake. As the photos/videos will show, the termites had a field day inside my suitcase, and small tiny ants are in all of my 21 sets of clothes. The bed is no ordinary vintage either, and the ants didnt let me sleep the first night. In the morning, i couldnt take it any more and requested for a change of the bedsheets.5. Hygiene: Probably the second worst i have seen amongst the hundreds of hotels i have stayed in. The photos speak for themselves, but imagine stains on duvet, on bedsheet, hair from previous i am guessing lady occupant in the bed, and so on.Overall, i think the service compensates for the bad food, but there is nothing that saves one from the poor hygiene overall.",1,"dear peeyush m,we are delighted to have you staying with us while you were in hong kong and thank you so much for sharing your stay experience. your positive comments regarding our service and room facilities are very much appreciated. on the other hand, we are sorry to have heard that you have noticed some areas need improvement, we are making effort on modifying our hardware to enhance our guest experience. we look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in another occasion. warm regards,the team of lan kwai fong hotel @ kau u fong","Responded December 28, 2021","mixed bag - super service, with horrible hygiene i am on day 7 of a 14 day quarantine. the hotel was a last minute booking with just one room available. so here are the pros and cons on day 7:1. service: check in was smooth. any food i order gets delivered promptly. any complaints i raise are addressed promptly. meal deliveries are timely.2. food: i am getting quarantine food. its edible about 60-70% of the time quite easily. the room service menu is very limited, but judging by the quality of the quarantine food, i have not ordered any room service, and cant say.3. wifi and connection: strongish.. i do face intermittent trouble on video calls sometimes, but the connection is smooth about 95% of the time, so its quite reliable. 4. room: tiny. i am supposedly in a 19 sq m room that doesnt feel like it. the table is long enough to accomodate two laptops. the chair is not a work chair, more like a stool with a small back. for long hours, its a disaster. imagine neck and shoulder sprain every day.4. furniture: should probably be burnt. its dated. i opened one bag when i arrived and kept it outside, thank goodness. however, my rimowa suitcase went straight in the cupboard to give the room some semblance of space. big mistake. as the photos/videos will show, the termites had a field day inside my suitcase, and small tiny ants are in all of my 21 sets of clothes. the bed is no ordinary vintage either, and the ants didnt let me sleep the first night. in the morning, i couldnt take it any more and requested for a change of the bedsheets.5. hygiene: probably the second worst i have seen amongst the hundreds of hotels i have stayed in. the photos speak for themselves, but imagine stains on duvet, on bedsheet, hair from previous i am guessing lady occupant in the bed, and so on.overall, i think the service compensates for the bad food, but there is nothing that saves one from the poor hygiene overall.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

They met my request of a nice Harbour View Room, on a high floor (31st) with a bathtub. There was ample space for me to do yoga. There is a seating area all across the windows and the huge windows reach the ceiling. I enjoyed sitting there, watching the sunset/sunrise over the harbour and having my meals. It was fantastic doing meditation with the sunrise over the harbour. The windows can be slightly opened and it was always great to have some fresh air. I requested egg free vegetarian food. The hotel complied. The food was delivered piping hot, mainly spaghetti and rice dishes. The hotel also does lots of healthy salads (kale, spinach, quinoa, potato, etc) which I love. I normally do not have a lot of dressing with my salads so was happy. I only used a little of the dressing provided and at times not at all.  I had carried with me, pita wraps and my favourite veggie noodles which I could mix with the salad. I did do a few food panda delivery (delivered to the room immediately) when I craved mexican food. It was nice to have nachos/salsa chips with my salad. The hotel also has a nice vegetarian/vegan dining menu which I ordered a few times and offset with my Dorsett reward Points.  Stainless steel cutlery is provided in the room although I had also brought my own. The breakfast was nice, I had boiled veggies, mini salad, baked beans with either toast or croissant. I ordered orange juice with my breakfast which I could blend with my plant protein shake. I only drink green tea and had brought my own favourite ones. The hotel provides them in the room as well. I was quite impressed with the amenities provided. The quality of the secured in-built shampoo, conditioner and bath gel is pretty good. I had brought my own just in case the shampoo/conditioner was not compatible with my hair type. I ended up interchanging between my own and the hotels. The water pressure was fantastic. I had showers and hot bubble baths. The hotel provides detergent which is great for cleaning up utensils. There are ample supply of towels and bottled water and if you run out, housekeeping will replenish right away. I only needed a few extra towels and another bottle of detergent during my stay. I changed my linens 7 days into the quarantine. I found the bed and pillows a bit too soft for me. I tend to sleep on a harder mattress. Nevertheless, I slept well and had a good night's sleep. The Wifi was fantastic and never had an issue. There is a proper desk and chair in the room, not very big though but I was able to work. When the windows are shut, there is complete pin drop silence in the room. This was important to me as I am on an intensive study program in the medical field. I was busy with my online lessons on zoom several hours a day during the week and had  reading and studying to do. Hence, I did not have too much time for TV. My only fear was that the health officials would show up for my PCR test while I was in the middle of my lesson. Thank goodness, they came earlier before my lessons began. The hotel likes to pleasantly surprise the quarantine guests. During my stay, on Halloween, we were gifted with a  smiley Pumpkin filled with sweets and goodies. Every Friday afternoon, we get desserts. I got 2 yum Mango Mochi ice cream. The hotel does not provide any washing powder, I had brought my own. There is a ladder of sorts in the bathroom, it's a deco where towels are kept. I hung my washed clothes there and on the bath railing. It dried out quickly. The only downside for me was trying to get a local sim card. You need a local number when booking a PCR test for after you leave the quarantine. They only send a local SMS. Besides, the results of all the PCR tests done are also sent via local SMS. Neither the airport, not the Hotel provided a local sim card. I ended up purchasing via food panda but they have a minimum amount for delivery. Otherwise, you would need a friend/family to deliver it to you. Everyone's experience, needs, preferences  and requirements are different.

The food was very hit and miss, with the asian options being much better than the western choices (and rice and the pastas were alright, but I would not recommend the salad options). I got sent the wrong food order a few times, but after I gave staff a call, my actual order was sent to me.I stayed in one of the hotel's 'Harbour view' rooms and it really was a view of the harbour, 30 floors up. I would recommend paying a bit more for a better view during quarantine, it makes a huge difference in how you feel. My room had a quite high ceiling as well, making the room feel bigger. The room had two windows that could be opened to let in fresh air, and a proper desk and chair so I was able to work during the day. I also brought an HDMI cable to use on the TV when watching Netflix, and I'd recommend others to do so as well.Staff were very accommodating and available directly via phone, and I definitely think they make an effort to make sure that you're as comfortable as possible, given the circumstances - you're sent a small treat of sorts every Friday afternoon from the hotel, which is nice. You're given a set of metal cutlery and a good amount of detergent to use, and the shower pressure is good. The bathroom has big secured bottles of hand wash, shampoo and lotion, and spare towels and sheets.

Here are some of the reasons it works well for me: the service is excellent, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and bring additional amenities if you need them, as well as occasional gifts and treats. (Special shout out to Vanessa Chung for her help and support!) It's a central location so easy to order food or groceries to be delivered, and they bring things up to your room with no delay. The food is reasonable, apart from a few things I didn't care for, but you will definitely want to order in sometimes to have a break from their menu. The windows open so you can get fresh air if you want a break from the A/C. The hotel will rent extras like a microwave, an office chair and exercise equipment - and I recommend all three! The bathroom has an excellent shower and a bathtub for those long evening soaks. The room layout is very well planned, with lots of light, space for exercise equipment, a desk and a comfortable window seat, so you can eat or relax looking out at the view. Did I mention the view? From the upper floors you have a panoramic view of Hong Kong harbour, so there is always something to look at.

I was deeply disappointed and felt grossly cheated at misrepresentation of the facts by the hotel and its poor service. The room size listed on the website (420 sq ft) turned out to be 330 sq ft in actual. The hotel informed me that their website showed the gross area and claimed it to be the hotel practice in Hong Kong. THIS IS SIMPLY UNTRUE as several other hotels have confirmed to me.  I chose this suite despite its unusually exorbitant price, purely because of the advertised  a large-size room in central location. A price that was significantly increased for quarantine guests and more expensive than the Kerry Hotel and comparable to the Mandarin. Despite this, it was particularly important and worth significant additional expense because I have claustrophobia. More so because I was to be confined to this for 21 days.  The hotel refused to make any changes and insisted that it was fair policy to list the gross area of the room on their website without specifying it. They failed to explain how gross the area was relevant during quarantine as the guests were totally confined to their room, even during a fire drill.  It seems clear to me that the hotel is trying to cheat the guests during an already mentally harrowing 21-day quarantine. It is so unfortunate that hotels like this are trying to exploit the unprecedented grave pandemic situation to fleece innocent Hong Kong residents. Their food and overall linen quality left much to be desired -- given the significant price difference between the suites and regular rooms, it seems unthinkable why the same mediocre quality would be provided to the suite occupants. I complained about the quality of the food but nothing was done to improve.  Surely this is not befitting the price commanded for the hotel.  All I can say -- DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

Great decision as these items go out of stock pretty quick . Wasn’t so lucky with the Dyson vacuum cleaner as it went out of stock soon . So eventually I got a tiny handheld vacuum delivered via HKTVMall. Occasionally I used the Dorsett mart to also get some room fresheners, snacks n drinks, etc. - any outside order/item delivered by vendors (HKTVMall, etc.), Deliveroo or by a friend…is placed by your room door within 5-10 mins of  receiving at the front-desk  . Was rather  shocked to hear that in some other  hotels it took ONE HOUR !!  - any requested supplies (e.g. the occasional extra bed sheet, teabags, coffee mate, etc) arrive within 5-10 mins of making the request over phone- the information given at the check-in time was well summarized on paper Documents and it was fairly accurate in terms of the daily menu of each date , outside delivery, weekly  pillow cases, garbage collection timings, etc. - staff are nice and in general they take action very quickly after the guest makes a request over phone- The regular meals from the hotel always arrive on time - The room charges are quite competitive and attractive- The PCR testing and sample collections  were done efficiently and didn’t take too long- The gift (cakes and tea bottles) received around day 13 were nice  - checkout was done efficiently and the concierge staff were so helpful in taking our huge luggage cases down to the lobby and arranging them inside the taxi for us  Could only find  the Dorsett room available due to the heavy demand for quarantine rooms.

It may be Dorsett TW is located in an industrial area, thus the land size is relatively bigger. However, my room doesn't have a view, its windows only face an industrial building block next door with dirty and moldy walls.  The only consolation is there is a small window view that I could have a glimpse of the sky.  But all the windows are not openable. So air-con all the way for the full stay. Plenty of toilet rolls and facial tissues are provided. A carton box of 24 bottles mineral water and an electrical kettle are included.

Reusable utensils for meals as well as dish washing detergent and sponge are provided. Wifi speed is quite adequate for watching YouTube or steaming Netflix programs. However, when I used Teams for multi-party video conferencing during the day, the video portion was lagging and blurry, but the voice part was auditable and no breaking.

(before 8am,12pm,6pm). i'm used to a lot of spice so at first the food seemed kinda bland but then later i got used to it lol, and there were a couple of days where i was really looking forward to meals. regarding service i didn't ask for much, so i have no complaints. they also gave us extra towels, tissues, sugar, toothbrush, tea, pillow cases like twice a week i think.yeah i'd recommend staying here  :)",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,,

At the time of booking, the Dorsett Tsuen Wan offered 45% off dining.  Upon check-in, I note that TripAdvisor had given this hotel a 4.  Here are the rules I was given... no leaving the room. No house keeping. No outside delivery of meals (only family members can deliver).  I don’t see what the difference is between family member delivering meals and Food Panda.  The meal discount (which was one of the reasons I choose Dorsett) is only 15% now.  Not off to a good start.The hotel appearance seem nice.  Room was tidy and “seemed” clean.  I received a quiet room on a high floor which is good.Upon closer inspection, the chair was dirty, remote control was dirty, telephone did not work and the replacement was dirty.  Hair in the bathroom.  The bed is very hard.Wanting to order food, I ran room service (no other choice).  Took 5 minutes for someone to answer.  Was told kitchen closed due to flooding?

We took the Sea view which is a huge benefit so highly recommended as the view is amazing and makes a difference. My main and recurring issue is the food. We get three meals a day. Apparently as a quarantine guest you get different food than if you were a hotel guest. So don’t expect the normal food you would get for breakfast or any other meal in your favorite 5 star hotel.

Nearly each meal had rice (either fried or steamed), mostly Asian cuisine, very dull flavored with the same plain soup every morning or lunch which I believe is from peas but not very edible. There is usually a small piece of bread with butter in each meal, and some small dessert which is the only normal thing I have found in the meals.

I cannot praise them enough. If you have to go through the quarantine process in Hong Kong, this is one of the best places.1. Their small rooms--mine is a mini queen--are affordable.2. Their staff is welcoming and understanding. I had many inquiries before checking-in and during my quarantine. They responded promptly and worked patiently with us.3. Their staff speak and write English very well. This may be important to non-Cantonese speakers.4.  Meals are included in the quarantine package and they use their own kitchen. Options include vegetarian, vegan and gluten free. They are of good quality and they lean towards Western and South/Southeast Asian palate. They also include one and two dishes from local vendors every day. Food delivery is allowed too.5. They offer a drink (wine, beer, soft drinks, juice, etc.) for happy hour.6. They even prepare a special meal for the last night of quarantine with a cocktail. This is a little touch that makes the stay special. Oh, almost forget, they also gave me a bottle of cava. :)7. Their big window panels make a huge difference; the light brightened up my mood.

I loved the mindful perks meant to cheer you up: free daily snacks and minibar, free happy hour drink + canapes, and a concierge service to pick up anything you need!You can order food delivery but it was impossible to go past the menu at Kommune. Breakfast is included and comes with barista made coffee and the new, creative vegan menu is not only better for the planet but absolutely delicious.

It's safety, serenity, luxury at an affordable price, and an escape. The property is very unique, particularly for HK. It's quite different from the usual HK hotel in that the rooms and property are chic, elegant, modern, and give a sense of joy. The furniture is very comfortable, the amenities are useful, and the toiletries are high quality. The little things - like water pressure, slippers, yoga mat, Apple TV - make the days go by fast in a long stay. Also, the food is great. The menus in the restaurant and in the in-room dining have so much variety that one doesn't need to go to other restaurants outside the hotel. The happy hour with complimentary drinks and snack is divine For people who are completing compulsory quarantine, all of this (furniture, amenities, food) is so important and makes the stay really satisfying. The restaurants are nice for chilling and working. The expansive space, with the outdoor terrace, gives an open and airy feel. Honestly, the design of this place is quite unique and impeccable. Probably the best part of Ovolo Southside though is the people. It's hard to name any one person because actually everyone - Isabel, Kinki, Rachel, Joe, Lauren, Sandy, Quinton, Joanne - are lovely. The team at Ovolo Southside is like a breath of fresh air - relaxed, kind, and caring. They use a WhatsApp system that makes it so, so easy to chat. From grocery and mask delivery to casual check-ins to see how I was doing during my quarantine, the team was always in touch.    Ovolo Southside is a really special place. It stands out in HK.

It’s probably ~220 sq ft vs the 350 sq ft advertised.Light: limited. Tinted windows looking at some building, limited natural light. Condition: clean as one could ask for. Didn’t have any issues with dustBathroom: very decent. Water pressure was amazing. Enough room to move around. No bathtub but I don’t care for one anywayBed: a bit of a downer. I *think* they’d joined 2 single mattresses to make a double. The center of the mattress would sink. I’ve had a history of issues with soft mattresses and I generally expect to struggle on hotel beds. But yeah, no positive surprise hereFood: this was the winner.

Alexa is there if you need her, the TV is huge and offers Apple and all of the other channels. The bathroom area is perfect, and the package I chose offered a breakfast and a 'happy hour' cocktail at 5pm daily. The menu is vegetarian and extremely good, but carnivores can easily order in, and staff bring anything you want using a dedicated Whatsapp request system.

But for me - and a very welcome addition, was the provision of a treadmill - I think by request- so I guiltlessly enjoyed a lot of the complimentary sweet treats that were delivered at intervals during my stay as well as the regularly stocked up nuts and other goodies available in the minibar area. I have so far survived my second quarantine - just need a negative result for the 12 day test - and will then leave for my apartment.

We were kindly offered a drink (we chose beer) while we took our time checking-in.  Our Platinum Room was spacious, clean and had a nice view.  For the next 14 days, the staff (Patrick, Rowin & housekeeping) took such good care of us from grocery shopping and delivering our deliveroo orders to offering complimentary daily happy hour cocktails/snacks and surprises to help us pass the time. We were given a direct WhatsApp to reception, so we could text them any time we needed something.  They were always quick to respond. We were lucky to have Veda as the hotel restaurant.

The Ovolo is the kind of non-conventional / boutique / hipster hotel with avant-garde design features worthy of any Instagram feed. Among the many quirky touches, I appreciated in particular the free mini bar, wine, champagne and martini glasses, alternate day housekeeping, Netflix option, remote-controlled blinds, and the impeccable service.

All these were of course trivial in my overall experience. A 14-day quarantine is dreadful, but if you had to do it at the Ovolo the process will likely be a breeze.

At the same time, for us who needs a quarantine room, Four Points, a literally brand new hotel, is perfect.  The size of the room is on the small size for sure, but everything is brand new.  The bathroom has a good sized shower with good pressure.  Everything is in good working order.  The only problem is the lack of drawers or closet space.  Despite similar design than the Sheraton Tung Chung next door, Four Points' room is smaller, has smaller closet space, and pretty much expected as Four Points is a cheaper brand.   For a 14-day stay, I find it perfectly acceptable.  I paid extra for the ocean view room, which made my quarantine more sane.  I highly recommend it for AvGeek, as you can at least passed  time by watching at planes.  The WIFI is decent and easy to connect.  Food wise - I was emailed the menu for my whole stay about a week prior to my arrival, asking for flight information and my choice of food for the whole 14 days.  The government mandates all these quarantine hotels to provide three meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  Four Points offer four choices for each meals - Asian, Western, Asian Vegetarian and Western Vegetarian.  For breakfast, it comes with one piece of whole fruit (orange or apple), and a small fruit salad.  For lunch, it comes with a packaged bread rolls - white or wheat.  For dinner, it comes with a packaged cookie (really thin though).  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I will not opt out of it, but lunch and dinner are really a bit heavy on the carbohydrate side.  Portion is definitely not sufficient for a normal adult.  I will avoid salad and Poke bowl, which made me sick.  Their barley is not cooked enough.  Thankfully Four Point allows all kind of food deliveries and they are delivered within reasonable amount of times.  There are plenty of food options now in Tung Chung and if you are overseas visitor, please install your food app (Deliveroo is my choice and please note that Uber eat is not great in this district!) prior to arrival.  For some reasons, Four Points is not pre-programed into these apps so you need to note that you are in Four Points in your remark field.  Service is excellent and the staffs are quick to answer phone calls.  They are able to deliver all these extra items, like towels, trash bags, bottled waters and the usual array of amenities in a speedy manner.  Just note that they are not allowed to provide any house cleaning and cannot enter your room during your quarantine.  While you can have fresh towels every day, you need to think about spaces to put your used towels.  I was able to rent a treadmill (foldable) for $100 daily and was quite happy with it.  However, given the latest outbreak in the hotel concerning a guest releasing large amount of virus due to his exercises, I don't know if the hotel will allow exercise equipments again.  I recommend you calling them for the latest amenities.

I still find the room spacious for a party of 2 (so long as you do not have many big luggage). The best part of the room room is definitely its cleanliness. The room is new and tidy; it makes my quarantine so much easier. Even when I checked out, the staff was so helpful (even though she was 15 minutes behind of the time scheduled). The only criticism is the knowledge of the staffs. One day, I received a call from the front desk who criticized me of not tying my trash bag (as required by the hotel) before leaving it outside of my door. Anyway, it found out that the staff has the wrong room number. Then, when I checked out, the staff told me that I do not need to do further Covid testing at local community centers after my 14-day quarantine. Again, this staff has provided wrong information. Thanks Goodness that I called HK Department of Health and sorted everything out (I do not want to break any laws!) Other than those two incidents, I have no complaints.

So worst-case scenario might be two guests in this room before me. The second criterion was that 900 HKD + 10% per day is an affordable price. The third reason I’m a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum member for life, and I was hoping for some special attention. The hotel is modern, and the room is quite efficient and well designed. I have been very well impressed during the booking process; I received an immediate reply to all my emails. Few days before starting your stay, you will get a SurveyMonkey questionnaire where you have to select all the meals for the three weeks. You have a choice of 3 options: Western, Vegetarian and Asian (they named Chinese, but there is a lot of Japanese and Thai also). There is an “At Your Service” line that is prompt and very efficient. You can call to get water replenished or asking more towels. They are incredibly professional. At check-in, you will be given a detailed paper with practical information about your stay. There is an “a la carte” menu available through a QRCode from one of my pictures. Through this app, you can book also fitness equipment directly from the hotel concierge delivered into your room. They accept delivery either from your friends/relatives or companies (I used Deliveroo with excellent results). To check out, you need to book few days in advance. During your stay, it is also active Pressreader app. The checkout process is simple: someone comes to pick you up at your room (the lifts are blocked) and you take different lifts from when you arrived. Then you go down and your checkout to a completely different desk you check in. The room assigned to me was a Traditional King Room, 20 sqmt facing west. I was getting light from half past noon until sunset. In the afternoon you need aircon because the room can go quickly around 27/28C (and we are in winter!!). It is well designed, with a small entrance, a small bathroom, and a large bedroom. Twenty sqmt is small; whatever you can play around, it is small. The first days I had a bit of a claustrophobic/rejection reaction (“tell me I am not to stay for three weeks in this place!”). In the entrance and the bathroom, there are friendly pavements easy to clean. In the bedroom instead, there is a carpet, that is dusty. The room is well furnished with many amenities: plenty of tissue boxes, toilet paper, towels (2 bathrobes, 2 for the body, 4 for face and 4 for hands, two sleepers, 1 hairdryer). The shower is small but functional, with body soap, conditioner, and shampoo dispensers on the wall. One bottle of 500 ml dishwashing detergent, one sponge, and another 500 ml detergent for laundry. They provide two coffee cups, two glasses, one water boiler, one cutlery set (including chopsticks), two dishes, plenty of instant coffee, jasmine tea, and English breakfast and sugars. There is one small fridge but working well, and they provided me a second one on demand. There is a full pack of a bottle of water when you enter, and you can ask as much as you like. There is an iron and an ironing board. There is a large and new Samsung Smart TV with an HDMI port. There is a good selection of international channels (from Australia, US, HK, Japan, France, GCC, Mainland, UK, India, Korea). Internet is quite good and easy to connect. There is a Yoga mat, a resistance band, a puzzle, and a large Walch Disinfectant Wipe box. I had a very comfortable king bed with even a 4 cm topper, a round table, a chair, and a stool. The windows are locked, large, and have a nice view of the sunset. There are plenty of sockets (HK type only), and a few of them have USB included. Lighting is adequate, not too bright, but the correct one, and you have a reading light on top of your head in the bed. All over – if you excuse the 20 sqmt - it is quite comfortable and well-designed room…",0,,,"good quarantine hotel i choose four points by sheraton tung chung because it opened on december 1, 2020, and my quarantine started on january 21, 2021. so worst-case scenario might be two guests in this room before me. the second criterion was that 900 hkd + 10% per day is an affordable price. the third reason i’m a marriott bonvoy platinum member for life, and i was hoping for some special attention. the hotel is modern, and the room is quite efficient and well designed. i have been very well impressed during the booking process; i received an immediate reply to all my emails. few days before starting your stay, you will get a surveymonkey questionnaire where you have to select all the meals for the three weeks. you have a choice of 3 options: western, vegetarian and asian (they named chinese, but there is a lot of japanese and thai also). there is an “at your service” line that is prompt and very efficient. you can call to get water replenished or asking more towels. they are incredibly professional. at check-in, you will be given a detailed paper with practical information about your stay. there is an “a la carte” menu available through a qrcode from one of my pictures. through this app, you can book also fitness equipment directly from the hotel concierge delivered into your room. they accept delivery either from your friends/relatives or companies (i used deliveroo with excellent results). to check out, you need to book few days in advance. during your stay, it is also active pressreader app. the checkout process is simple: someone comes to pick you up at your room (the lifts are blocked) and you take different lifts from when you arrived. then you go down and your checkout to a completely different desk you check in. the room assigned to me was a traditional king room, 20 sqmt facing west. i was getting light from half past noon until sunset. in the afternoon you need aircon because the room can go quickly around 27/28c (and we are in winter!!). it is well designed, with a small entrance, a small bathroom, and a large bedroom. twenty sqmt is small; whatever you can play around, it is small. the first days i had a bit of a claustrophobic/rejection reaction (“tell me i am not to stay for three weeks in this place!”). in the entrance and the bathroom, there are friendly pavements easy to clean. in the bedroom instead, there is a carpet, that is dusty. the room is well furnished with many amenities: plenty of tissue boxes, toilet paper, towels (2 bathrobes, 2 for the body, 4 for face and 4 for hands, two sleepers, 1 hairdryer). the shower is small but functional, with body soap, conditioner, and shampoo dispensers on the wall. one bottle of 500 ml dishwashing detergent, one sponge, and another 500 ml detergent for laundry. they provide two coffee cups, two glasses, one water boiler, one cutlery set (including chopsticks), two dishes, plenty of instant coffee, jasmine tea, and english breakfast and sugars. there is one small fridge but working well, and they provided me a second one on demand. there is a full pack of a bottle of water when you enter, and you can ask as much as you like. there is an iron and an ironing board. there is a large and new samsung smart tv with an hdmi port. there is a good selection of international channels (from australia, us, hk, japan, france, gcc, mainland, uk, india, korea). internet is quite good and easy to connect. there is a yoga mat, a resistance band, a puzzle, and a large walch disinfectant wipe box. i had a very comfortable king bed with even a 4 cm topper, a round table, a chair, and a stool. the windows are locked, large, and have a nice view of the sunset. there are plenty of sockets (hk type only), and a few of them have usb included. lighting is adequate, not too bright, but the correct one, and you have a reading light on top of your head in the bed. all over – if you excuse the 20 sqmt - it is quite comfortable and well-designed room…",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,

Really went by quickly and I recommend staying here. The room is indeed small as others have pointed out, but it's clean, bright (we had an Ocean View Room) and with plenty of plug and USB charging points. Watching the boats moving around and the planes taking off and landing provided some entertainment! We had a queen size bed so we were unable to move around any of the furniture to make a 'work-out' space, but the hallway area was sufficient for my youtube video workouts and morning stretches. Our travel plans changed several times in advance of our trip and the reservations team were quick to respond, friendly and accommodating with our changes. Thank you to Tommy and Billy for all of your help. They demonstrated good knowledge of the various quarantine restrictions per country and made us feel more comfortable about our trip back to HK.Food was decent and portions were plentiful. Food quality was similar to going to your local cha chaang teng (in my opinion). We stuck mostly to the Chinese food options as we thought this would likely be better, though the few Western options we had were okay too. Only had 1 meal that was truly bad and gave me an upset stomach. I'd say that's pretty good odds over 21 meals. Nice to have fresh fruit (apples, bananas and oranges) as well as small fruit bowls too. The food is delivered lukewarm so investing in some sort of small steamer or hotplate is worthwhile. Once the food was hot and served on a plate, it magically tasted much better! You can reserve a microwave, but we heard these were in short supply, so you may want to plan in advance. We also bought plenty of snacks in our suitcase, so we were grateful to have these when we wanted to have an afternoon tea or coffee. We ordered Deliveroo and some beers from 7-11 once in the midst of our quarantine as a treat. They were both brought to the room about 20 minutes after being delivered to the hotel (as per the Deliveroo app), which is not bad. We received a small treat (Doritos and tomato juice) for Friday happy hour, which is a nice touch. Staff was helpful. Sometimes difficult to get ahold of them when calling during busy hours (basically, any meal times) but everything we asked for was delivered quickly (such as another set of cutlery, new towels, etc). Check-out was smooth and painless. Someone arrived exactly on-time with a trolley for us to place our luggage on. A staff member has to meet you at your room and take you downstairs since you can't operate the lifts on your own.  We walked through the lobby, handed in our lanyards and that was it!

The room itself and all amenities were great. Unfortunately the service was poor. Whenever I would try and call to ask for something- the phone would just ring and ring without response. I actually called and asked to speak with the manager at one point but my call was never returned and the manager never contacted me. At one point I was able to get someone on the phone to ask for my food delivery to be sent up to my room (the food had arrived 1 hour and had still not been sent up at that point). The person I spoke with wanted to argue with me claiming they were ""very buys"". No apology- nothing. I can accept that the staff was busy. What I cannot accept is the refusal of the staff and/or management to try and at least attempt to make things better. It was like they just did not care.

This was my second hotel quarantine and I can't express how well the hotel took care of me.  The rooms here are small but nice and new and I fortunately they had availability for me to book a 2 room interconnecting package and I had paid to upgrade my meals to the VIP meal package. They have done a very smart thing in the 2 room setup by removing the beds from one room and turning it into a workspace / living space and exercise space - basically like a small suite with the most outstanding sea view and airport view.  In fact on a good day you can see the buildings in Zhuhai.  And a beautiful sunset view every evening! The bathrooms are a decent size and the shower is actually larger than I expected (and with the 2 room setup there are 2 bathrooms). I'm very glad I upgraded my meal package.

My first quarantine was in April and was for 21 days.  This stay was in September and for only 14 days due to relaxed quarantine requirements for vaccinated travellers to Hong Kong. My review of my earlier stay already sets out in detail all aspects of the room and service so I will simply refer you to it: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d3445901-r786967742-Mira_Moon_Hotel-Hong_Kong.htmlThis time, I found the hotel has made several changes which has improved the quality of the stay and some seemed to be directed at the comments I made in my earlier stay such as:(1)  real metal fork and knife is now provided in the room so I no longer need to try to cut a steak or a fruit with the disposable popsicle stick type thin wooden knife provided with the meals;(2)  now staff do ring the doorbell to let me know my meal has been delivered instead of just knocking on the door;(3)  during my earlier stay I requested a small side table that I could set by the window side of the bed so I could watch the TV while eating my meals and the concierge remembered and already had the small side table left in my room when I checked in; (4)  similarly I had requested a cleaning towel during my first stay and again, one was already left in my room when I checked in.  In terms of other nice touches, I arrived on the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the hotel thoughtfully left a package of two mini mooncakes on the desk in the room to greet me on arrival, and another pack was delivered with the lunch.  Also as soon as I checked in, the concierge gave me call to check whether I had everything I needed. I had issues with the wifi in the room one night, called reception and after trying some fixes to no avail, reception sent up a portable wifi unit to try to help me to connect.  Everything was handled very promptly despite it being late at night.  One morning, after a stormy night, I woke to find the air conditioning had gone out and that there were small leaves on the floor where the air conditioning vents blew out to.  I called reception and they advised they were already aware of the problem, engineering staff were working on it, and that they expected service would resume soon, which it did.  I did have an issue they could not fix - the door over the cabinet under the coffee machine where the mini fridge is stored fell off one of its two hinges and was half hanging on and could only be opened with difficulty.  Reception advised quarantine rules prevented their sending staff into my room to repair, so I simply emptied out the fridge of the things I needed to use.  It was only a few days before the end of my quarantine so it was not too much of an inconvenience. Finally, I also noticed there was a bit of cleaning issue around the round piece of carpet under the red swivel chair in the room.  When I moved the chair with the round piece of carpet it sat on to another position along the window side of the bed, I found quite a few long hairs that were not mine that had been trapped on or under the carpet.  Food remained very good at Mira Moon.  Many of the menu items were ones I recognized from my earlier stay but since I enjoyed them the first time, I was happy to enjoy them again.  There were also a number of new menu items which I liked very much including in particular a Thai style roasted pork with a delicious sour and spicy dipping sauce.  Desserts also seemed improved.  There were fewer repeats of dessert items and the new dessert items I did not have during my first stay were ones I enjoyed more - such as oatmeal cookies instead of mini muffins.  Lastly I did want to mention how wonderfully accommodating staff at the hotel were when I had to move my travel earlier by one week.  Due to my parents' health needs, I wanted to travel to Hong Kong earlier.  The initial date I selected was fully booked so I gave Mira Moon a list of 4 dates over a space of two weeks that I could travel on as there were flights on Cathay Pacific and staff did watch for cancellations and notify each time one of those dates became available.  I was not able to take advantage of the first date that became available as it was too short notice to arrange pre-flight Covid-19 testing but I was able to take advantage of the second date that became available when Mira Moon notified me.  They even agreed to hold the room for me for a couple of days so I could confirm my flight change first before changing my quarantine hotel booking.  Travelling during the pandemic is stressful with a need to monitor for government rule changes and a need to be flexible with one's plans and to react quickly.  The efforts from the Mira Moon staff to accommodate my wish to change the date of my booking certainly made it much less stressful to organize.",1,"dear vanctraveller,thank you again for taking your time to share such comprehensive review and your quarantine tips definitely helps other to plan their next quarantine stay in hong kong. it is our great pleasure to hear that you had another wonderful experience over the moon and glad that our reservation team was able to extend their most flexibility to accommodate your booking change request. i will certainly share your kind remarks to the entire team as this definitely an encouragement for our team to further in pursuit towards service excellence.thank you again for your support and we hope to welcoming you back again for another wonderful stay.best regards,kevin kofront office managermira moon hotel","Responded October 23, 2021","still excellent quarantine stay, second time i returned to the mira moon for a second quarantine stay this year.  my first quarantine was in april and was for 21 days.  this stay was in september and for only 14 days due to relaxed quarantine requirements for vaccinated travellers to hong kong. my review of my earlier stay already sets out in detail all aspects of the room and service so i will simply refer you to it: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/showuserreviews-g294217-d3445901-r786967742-mira_moon_hotel-hong_kong.htmlthis time, i found the hotel has made several changes which has improved the quality of the stay and some seemed to be directed at the comments i made in my earlier stay such as:(1)  real metal fork and knife is now provided in the room so i no longer need to try to cut a steak or a fruit with the disposable popsicle stick type thin wooden knife provided with the meals;(2)  now staff do ring the doorbell to let me know my meal has been delivered instead of just knocking on the door;(3)  during my earlier stay i requested a small side table that i could set by the window side of the bed so i could watch the tv while eating my meals and the concierge remembered and already had the small side table left in my room when i checked in;

On arrival we were delighted with the room (Full Moon). The bedroom and bathroom were both large and comfortable with a reasonable view of the harbour.  If anything the pictures on the Internet do not do the rooms credit, they are actually larger than they look. Amenities such as a kettle, coffee maker etc were good. The bed was large and comfortable and the air con had excellent control from cool to heat. Food had been a worry as we had heard horror stories from other hotels.

Hotel reception was excellent and whenever we asked for extras - towels, coffee, bottled water etc. they always arrived quickly.

Mira Moon Hotel,d3445901,r808340914,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d3445901-r808340914-Mira_Moon_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html,"Reviewed September 5, 2021 ",2021,DBE0C279D1AE0DEF7193302B6BA2A88E,5,Excellent quarantine hotel,"The first and most important message I want to convey about quarantine hotel in Hong Kong is “Book early, book fast”. One of the entry requirements to land in Hong Kong is a confirmed reservation at an approved quarantine hotel for the required period. I had to book for fourteen days since I came from Canada, a Group B country. One should check the list regularly to make sure one has booked the required period, or else one would be denied entry. Reservation - As I indicated before, one should check for quarantine hotel availability before buying the airline ticket. One should book directly with the hotel, rather than using a booking service. The hotel would send you a link for payment but there was some trouble with it for three separate people using different credit cards. Fortunately the reservations department, especially Nicole, was very helpful and understanding. The hotel’s confirmation letter was necessary to enter Hong Kong. One would receive Bonvoy points for the quarantine stay as well.Accommodation - With less than one hundred rooms, the supply was tight. I had to book the Full Moon room because of availability. It turned out to be a good choice for a fourteen day stay. The room was roomy (410 sq. ft.) and it had a modern feel with everything one would need for two weeks. There was a complimentary supply of bottled water, tea and coffee from a Nespresso machine. Also in the room was a 48” television and a mini fridge. Bathroom included a shower with rain shower head and a tub. An iPad Mini was included for complimentary use. Wi-fi was adequate for most purposes but a bit spotty with WhatsApp video calls. There were Bluetooth enabled ceiling speakers in the room and they could be connected to the television or your own devices. Also there was a wall panel of connectors including HDMI, S-Video and RCA stereo plus video for the television. Towels were supplied upon request. There was a hotel WhatsApp phone number to contact the concierge. Kevin and Tiffany were most helpful.Safety - Mira Moon had very strict instructions in writing and also posted signs in the room regarding not leaving the room. There was ample supply of disinfecting wipes in the room and one could ask for more if needed. There was no contact with staff after checking in. Everything in the room was clean and felt sanitized. Luckily there were only four rooms on each floor and none of the room doors faced each other. In addition the windows in the rooms could not be opened. I said lucky because there was actually a case of cross infection in another quarantine hotel during required PCR COVID testing when one room had the windows opened while they opened the door. The guest from across the hall got infected when she opened the door for testing.Meals - included in the price was three meals daily and this was where Mira Moon excelled. Upon confirmation of booking, I received an email to order my meals. There was a choice of Chinese, International or vegetarian meal for each day and the menu repeated every two weeks. That meant I got a different dish everyday. The food was apparently supplied from the Miramar Hotel kitchen. The only minor complaints was that the food was not very hot when it got to my room.In summary, the stay at Mira Moon was a bright spot in a difficult situation of quarantine upon arrival in Hong Kong. I highly recommend it.",1,"dear vcr_traveler515,thank you for taking time to share such comprehensive review about your quarantine stays experience and your review definitely helps other plan their next quarantine stay in hong kong.!it is our pleasure to learn that how wonderful your stay was. providing a high level of hospitality and strictly follow the guideline to maintain a safety accommodation has always been our mission during this special quarantine period. i am pleased to hear that you were satisfied with our services from the time you make the reservation and during the stay. our moonwalkers have taken the step to make the quarantine as easy as possible and glad to see that you had a quality me time over the moon! thank you for recommending us on the tripadvisor community and we will be sure to keep up the good work and would love to have you back again next time for another wonderful experience. best regards,kevin kofront office manager","Responded September 9, 2021","excellent quarantine hotel the first and most important message i want to convey about quarantine hotel in hong kong is “book early, book fast”. one of the entry requirements to land in hong kong is a confirmed reservation at an approved quarantine hotel for the required period. i had to book for fourteen days since i came from canada, a group b country. one should check the list regularly to make sure one has booked the required period, or else one would be denied entry. reservation - as i indicated before, one should check for quarantine hotel availability before buying the airline ticket. one should book directly with the hotel, rather than using a booking service. the hotel would send you a link for payment but there was some trouble with it for three separate people using different credit cards. fortunately the reservations department, especially nicole, was very helpful and understanding. the hotel’s confirmation letter was necessary to enter hong kong. one would receive bonvoy points for the quarantine stay as well.accommodation - with less than one hundred rooms, the supply was tight. i had to book the full moon room because of availability. it turned out to be a good choice for a fourteen day stay. the room was roomy (410 sq. ft.) and it had a modern feel with everything one would need for two weeks. there was a complimentary supply of bottled water, tea and coffee from a nespresso machine. also in the room was a 48” television and a mini fridge. bathroom included a shower with rain shower head and a tub. an ipad mini was included for complimentary use. wi-fi was adequate for most purposes but a bit spotty with whatsapp video calls. there were bluetooth enabled ceiling speakers in the room and they could be connected to the television or your own devices. also there was a wall panel of connectors including hdmi, s-video and rca stereo plus video for the television. towels were supplied upon request. there was a hotel whatsapp phone number to contact the concierge. kevin and tiffany were most helpful.safety - mira moon had very strict instructions in writing and also posted signs in the room regarding not leaving the room. there was ample supply of disinfecting wipes in the room and one could ask for more if needed. there was no contact with staff after checking in. everything in the room was clean and felt sanitized. luckily there were only four rooms on each floor and none of the room doors faced each other. in addition the windows in the rooms could not be opened. i said lucky because there was actually a case of cross infection in another quarantine hotel during required pcr covid testing when one room had the windows opened while they opened the door. the guest from across the hall got infected when she opened the door for testing.meals - included in the price was three meals daily and this was where mira moon excelled. upon confirmation of booking, i received an email to order my meals. there was a choice of chinese, international or vegetarian meal for each day and the menu repeated every two weeks. that meant i got a different dish everyday. the food was apparently supplied from the miramar hotel kitchen. the only minor complaints was that the food was not very hot when it got to my room.in summary, the stay at mira moon was a bright spot in a difficult situation of quarantine upon arrival in hong kong. i highly recommend it.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,,

Hong Kong requires arriving air passengers to take government provided shuttle buses to their pre-booked designated quarantine hotel.  There were about 7 different shuttle bus routes each going to 4 or 5 different hotels in an area.  There were only 7 passengers on the bus I took for the Causeway/Wanchai area and fortunately, Mira Moon was the first hotel on the route that day.  3 of the 7 passengers were staying at Mira Moon.  On arrival of the shuttle bus, hotel staff in full head to toe protective gowns met the bus, took the passengers’ luggage, and separated them for each passenger.  I was the first to check in.  Each person was checked in separately so I was not in close contact with the other 2 passengers also checking into Mira Moon.  Check in was quick, staff in full protective gown was behind a plastic shield and everything was passed to me through a slot at the bottom of the plastic shield.  I received a number of handouts about the hotel’s quarantine stay rules, the procedure for in hotel Covid-19 testing on day 12 and 19, etc.  I was then directed to the elevator in which my luggage was already pre-loaded and went up toe my room.  The room key card can only be used once to enter my room since quarantine rules require I not leave my room for the entire 21 day quarantine.  I thought the process was very efficient and organized with good Covid safety measures.In accordance with a promotion when I booked, I was upgraded from a standard room to a Half-Moon Room on the 35th floor, one below the top floor.  The promotion was an upgrade to either a Half Moon or a Full Moon room with the Full Moon being slightly larger at 410 sq. ft. compared to the Half Moon at 380 sq. ft.  The standard room, called New Moon, is much smaller at 220 sq. ft and such rooms are on the opposite side of the building from the Half Moon and Full Moon rooms and have city views only.  Though smaller in size, it seems the Half Moon rooms have the better view since my room 3502 was at the corner facing the harbour view out to Kowloon, whereas further along that side of the hotel I think the view would be mostly blocked by a building just across from Mira Moon.  On entering, I found the room was exactly as pictured on the hotel’s website.  The décor has lots of dark wood trim with mostly Asian style furniture and bold splashes of red on the wall at the head of the bed and in a design pattern on the sheers.  Fortunately the room had lots of full length windows and being a corner room, light from two sides, so the room was very bright and open in the daytime.  The room had a king size bed, a side glass topped work desk with chair, a coffee station with a Nespresso machine, a kettle and a mini fridge underneath, a good sized closet with two bathrobes hanging inside, and a comfy red swivel chair in the corner from which to enjoy the harbour view.  There was also a large wall mounted TV facing the bed. The room also had a massive bathroom with full size free standing soaker bathtub, angled to face the harbour view (though not sure how I could enjoy the view from the bathtub since if I kept the blackout drapes open and closed only the sheers, I would also be looking at the residential building to my side across from the Mira Moon and the many occupants of the residential building).  There was also a separate shower, a large desk type vanity with a large but somewhat shallow sink on top facing a mirrored wall, and a separate cubicle for the toilet with a glass door.  The door to the bathroom was also mirrored on both sides which adds to the appearance of size and openness and, angled properly, allows me to see the TV from either the toilet or the sink.  There is a speaker system in the bathroom that can broadcast what the TV is viewing.  Inside the room at the coffee station, there were 6 large 1.5 litre bottles of water and staff indicated I could request more water as needed.  Also provided were two types of Nespresso capsules – Ispirazione Firenze and Vivalto Lungo Decaffeinato - and two types of tea bags – Royal Darjeeling and Grand Jasmine - and again, I could request more capsules or tea bags as needed.  In the bathroom, extra toiletries, toilet paper, tissue were placed in anticipation of the extended stay.  There was also a welcome tin of candies on the desk with a welcome note from the hotel.  Also on the desk was a pack of 60 sheets of 75% alcohol wipes – a handy item which I used to clean the desk after meals.  Beside the bed on a small round Chinese style side table was an iPad mini preloaded with some apps that reported on the weather and accessed certain TV channels and pay movies.  The iPad mini was very old and its stand/cover was so worn that the iPad mini could not really be stood up in the cover stand.  I did not really find the iPad mini of much use during my stay. Note that the hotel does not provide any ceramic cups, plates or cutlery inside the room.  Instead, the coffee station drawer is equipped with some paper cups and very thin wood disposable cutlery is delivered with each meal (and wood chopsticks for Chinese meals).  Fortunately, I had brought my own ceramic mug and reusable travel fork and spoon having read articles on quarantining that suggest having such items might be comforting.  The thin wood disposable knife and fork were often not quite up to the job.  T he fork was not very sharp and had trouble stabbing into food items.  The knife was even less helpful – ok for cutting open the bread rolls and buttering them, but hopeless for use to cut any meat or even chicken items or for cutting the fruits provided with meals.  Having experienced the use of the wood disposable cutlery the first couple of meals, I asked my family to drop off real metal cutlery for me.In order to make for easy cleaning and disinfection, all the light switches, phone handsets and the remote control were plastic wrapped.  This even extended to the pillows which were sealed in plastic bags and then the pillow cases were put on top.  This resulted in the pillows making some noise when you sleep on them.  I was not bothered by this and do understand that it is much easier just to change the pillow cases rather than try to clean the pillow itself, and this also gave me some comfort I was not making contact with a pillow that someone else in a quarantine stay made contact with.  However, I understand from other reviews on Tripadvisor that others found it very vexing to sleep on noisy pillows.  I had a bit more issue with the plastic covered and wrapped controls as sometimes the wrap was affixed too tight such that light switches, phone or remote control would not work well as the buttons were not able to bounce back after being pressed, but it was an easy thing to fix just by pulling on the plastic wrap a bit to loosen it and pressing a couple more times.  The room appeared to be well cleaned and I did not spot any issues other than that the metal base of the red swivel chair did not appear to have been cleaned at all and was covered with dust. The most obvious missing item in the room is some kind of side table that could be used for meals and that could be positioned so that I could watch the TV while eating.  The only desk in the room faces the wall, is located to the side of the TV and cannot see the TV.  It is large and cannot be easily moved particularly since the rabbit shaped desk lamp affixed to the desk is plugged into an outlet in the wall.  I wanted to try to create a separate eating area on the other side of the room near the windows where the red swivel chair was located and from which I could see the TV.  There were two Chinese style small round side tables beside the bed but they were too small to hold the meal containers and drink cups.  I initially contacted the virtual concierge through WhatsApp to request a tray and perhaps an extra luggage stand to create my own side table but was told nothing was available.  Luckily, about a week into my quarantine, I made contact with Kevin Ko, the assistant front office manager and he made extra efforts to find me options and ended up sourcing a black stool, a silver round side table and an extra plastic tray for me to consider.  I ended up using the silver round side table and tray to create my dining area for the rest of my quarantine.   All designated hotels are required to provide 3 meals a day to quarantine guests.  Mira Moon has a very strong food program with 3 choices for each of the three daily meals – a vegetarian option, a local touch option and an international option.  The hotel e-mailed the menu for my entire stay to me once I booked, together with a separate website link for ordering the meals for each day.  The menu is on a 2 week cycle and repeats after 14 days.  Meal selections must be made 5 days in advance or else the hotel will select the meal choice for the guest.  Meal service times are fixed – 8-9 am for breakfast, 12:30-1:30 pm for lunch and 6:30-7:30 for dinner.  Most meals are delivered to my room within the first 15 min of the one hour time range for meal service and only twice did I have to call to inquire about meals – once when I first checked in and lunch was not delivered until I called front desk close to 2 pm and a second time on day 9 when I called at 8:55 am to inquire just as breakfast was delivered.  Staff will sometimes knock and sometimes knock and ring the bell when delivering meals.  There were a couple of times when I might have not heard the knock and did not pick up my food until much later so it might be a good idea to periodically check outside the door at meal times if meals appear to be a bit late.  A few times during the quarantine, on days 15, 16 and 20, lunch came unexpectedly early by about 15 minutes around 12:15 pm.  I was worried about the quality and quantity of food since food is a frequent complaint in reviews about designated quarantine hotels so I did prepare by bringing lots of snacks with me and chose the Mira Moon to be close to family so that they can drop off items for me if needed.  My concern was completely unfounded as the food provided by Mira Moon was consistently plentiful and delicious.  Eventhough I never selected the vegetarian option, I was also never short of vegetables as different vegetables were always included as part of lunch and dinner.  Mira Moon also provides a daily dessert with lunch and dinner each day.  Most of the time the dessert would be a mini muffin of one of 4 flavours (green one matcha I guess, blueberry, lemon poppyseed and chocolate) but sometimes it would be a small piece of chocolate mousse cake or brownie and a few times it would be something completely different and new such as mini tapioca in coconut milk with blueberries and raspberry, almond jelly, or pineapple cake.  During the first week, no fruits were provided with meals but at the end of the first week, a small container of fruits (an apple, orange, kiwi, banana and some grapes) was delivered to my room together with a note from the hotel congratulating me on completing one week of quarantine.  Starting in the second week, a fruit was included with each lunch – an apple, a pear or a banana.  At the end of the second week of quarantine, again there was a container delivered to my room with a note congratulating me on completing two weeks of quarantine and this time the treat was a traditional Hong Kong egg tart.  Then on day 19 with 3 days to go in the quarantine, hotel sent up a card with a pack of Lush bubble bath. In general, I found the local touch lunches and dinner tended to be smaller in portion size than the international ones but were still substantial and enough for me.  With breakfast, the local touch option tended to be the bigger meal since it was usually congee accompanied by a large serving of noodle of some kind.  I discovered after a few days that it was actually too much food to eat up everything that was provided since breads (buns, corn bread roll, mini croissants) were also provided with each international meal lunch and dinner.  The mini croissants were a favourite, so good I did not even need to put butter or jam on it.  Favourite meals during the quarantine included the duck dishes whenever available as it was always perfectly cooked.  Fish was also frequently included as a choice either under local touch or international so it was not meat and chicken all the time.  However, for the Day 11 local touch dinner of steamed seabass fillet with shrimp paste fried rice, there was a fish bone so be aware to be careful.  To give other potential quarantine stay guests a complete picture of what quarantine meals would be like at Mira Moon, I posted photos and a mini review of every meal at Mira Moon on Tripadvisor which can be found by:  (1) clicking on traveller photos on the top right hand corner of the review page for Mira Moon, (2) selecting “recency” rather than “featured” in the filter at the right hand side, and (3) scrolling through as necessary until you see a series of food photos. Being stuck in a hotel room for 3 weeks, some form of routine physical activity is essential.  The hotel thoughtfully provides a yoga mat for use in the room.  While I do not practice yoga, I did appreciate the thin but nicely cushioned mat and used it to do push-ups, stretches, crunches, etc. to maintain a basic exercise routine.  In terms of service, I thought the Mira Moon staff did a really good job.  When friends and family dropped off items for me, they were delivered to my room very promptly.  Similarly when I requested extra amenity items such as Nespresso coffee pods or additional paper cups, the items were promptly delivered to the tray outside my room.  The one quirk in both delivery of service items and meals is that some staff will ring the doorbell and some will just knock on the door, sometimes very softly, so if one is expecting a delivery, one might need to periodically check the door. In the beginning, I would call hotel reception with questions and requests but then noticed from the handouts that I can contact the hotel concierge on WhatsApp instead which then became the more convenient and usual method for me to contact hotel staff with requests. There was one hiccup on the service side.  The government arranges for testing of all quarantine guests on day 12 and day 19 of their quarantine and staff from the government contractor will actually drive around to the different designated quarantine hotels in their area, go to the room of each guest due for testing, and test you while you sit in a chair in your doorway (staff even bring a rolling air suction device with them and position the nozzle near your mouth to vacuum away droplets from your breathing before they ask you to take off your mask so they can take a nose and a throat sample with swabs).  For the day 12 test, everything was well organized.  The contractor BGI called me two days before to let me know I was due for testing and that they would be at the hotel between 9 am and 8 pm.  I contacted the hotel concierge to request that they call me when testing staff show up so that I can prepare, concierge did call me at around 9:08 am on arrival of testing staff to let me know they would be at my door in the next 20-30 minutes, testing staff knocked at my door around 9:30 am, and I was ready with my chair, ID and wastepaper basket (for disposal of gloves etc. that testing staff use).  For the day 19 testing however, I did not receive any call, text or e-mail from the testing contractor (which I understand was changed to Acecgt Diagnostic from BGI) letting me know they would be coming and when, hotel staff did not call me to let me know testing staff arrived, I was in the washroom when testing staff knocked on my door around 3:35 pm but fortunately could hear them knock, and had to ask them to wait for a couple of minutes while I got ready.  I WhatsApp’ed hotel concierge after the test to complain and did receive a call back saying the government had changed the testing contractor from BGI to Acecgt, hotel had tried to contact Acecgt to coordinate their arrival time but did not hear back from the company, and when Acecgt testing staff arrived at the hotel the concierge staff were busy with other guests and therefore did not get a chance to call me and the other guests being tested that day to give us a warning to prepare.  I appreciate the hotel was put at a disadvantage since the new contractor Acecgt was obviously much less organized and cooperative than the previous contractor BGI.  However, I would have thought no matter how busy staff were, better efforts could have been made to give a quick call to those guests who are to be tested that they should prepare for testing staff given that last time there was 20 minutes or so between testing staff arrival at the hotel and their showing up at my door (as I assume it takes testing staff some time to fully gown up and prepare their rolling air vacuum machine).  I was in the washroom and literally could have been all wet in the bathtub when testing staff showed up to knock on my door without warning from hotel staff. On check-out date, government rules require that I contact the hotel to confirm before I can leave my room, I assume in order to make sure I would not cross paths with other exiting guests or any incoming guests.  I pre-arranged check-out at 11 am and called the front office about 5 minutes before to get their confirmation I may leave my room and to ask them to unlock the elevator for me to go to reception on the 5th floor.  Check-out was efficient and orderly.  Of the two elevators, one was reserved for incoming guests and one for outgoing guests.  Hotel staff were again behind plexiglass barriers and everything was passed back and forth in trays through a slot at the bottom of the plexiglass barrier.  I was out of the hotel within minutes.  At ground level, again the path was cordoned off so that I would exit towards the back and side, which is different than the way I entered the hotel 3 weeks earlier.  Everything seemed well organized from the perspective of prevention of contact and transmission between guest.  Towards the last week of my quarantine, I noticed the room across the hall from me was occupied as I could see meals being left outside the door.  I asked the hotel when I checked out and the hotel confirmed that they are pretty fully occupied with quarantine guests, likely as a result of the Hong Kong government reducing the number of designated quarantine hotels and the number of rooms reserved for quarantine guests. Prior to booking, I did compare prices for designated quarantine hotels in the Causeway Bay area and with the promotion offer of upgrade to a Half Moon or Full Moon room for booking a standard room, the Mira Moon was well priced to provide better value with a much larger room, great harbour meal and much better meals.",1,"dear vanctraveller,thank you for taking your time to share such

our spacious room, meals and the heartfelt hospitality from our moon walkers during your 21 days quarantine. as from your observations, you already aware that designated quarantine hotel has strict

comfortable accommodation for our guest.thank you again for your valuable comment and your comment definitely motivate us to continually deliver a quality and thoughtful service and we look forward to welcoming you back hopefully for staycation in the future.best regards,kevin koassistant front office manager","Responded May 13, 2021","very good value, huge room, great meals at designated quarantine hotel for 21 day quarantine i just completed a 21 day mandatory arrival quarantine at the mira moon hotel and was very satisfied with the hotel and its offerings and services. hong kong requires arriving air passengers to take government provided shuttle buses to their pre-booked designated quarantine hotel.  there were about 7 different shuttle bus routes each going to 4 or 5 different hotels in an area.  there were only 7 passengers on the bus i took for the causeway/wanchai area and fortunately, mira moon was the first hotel on the route that day.  3 of the 7 passengers were staying at mira moon.  on arrival of the shuttle bus, hotel staff in full head to toe protective gowns met the bus, took the passengers’ luggage, and separated them for each passenger.  i was the first to check in.  each person was checked in separately so i was not in close contact with the other 2 passengers also checking into mira moon.  check in was quick, staff in full protective gown was behind a plastic shield and everything was passed to me through a slot at the bottom of the plastic shield.  i received a number of handouts about the hotel’s quarantine stay rules, the procedure for in hotel covid-19 testing on day 12 and 19, etc.  i was then directed to the elevator in which my luggage was already pre-loaded and went up toe my room.  the room key card can only be used once to enter my room since quarantine rules require i not leave my room for the entire 21 day quarantine.  i thought the process was very efficient and organized with good covid safety measures.in accordance with a promotion when i booked, i was upgraded from a standard room to a half-moon room on the 35th floor, one below the top floor.  the promotion was an upgrade to either a half moon or a full moon room with the full moon being slightly larger at 410 sq. ft. compared to the half moon at 380 sq. ft.  the standard room, called new moon, is much smaller at 220 sq. ft and such rooms are on the opposite side of the building from the half moon and full moon rooms and have city views only.  though smaller in size, it seems the half moon rooms have the better view since my room 3502 was at the corner facing the harbour view out to kowloon, whereas further along that side of the hotel i think the view would be mostly blocked by a building just across from mira moon.  on entering, i found the room was exactly as pictured on the hotel’s website.  the décor has lots of dark wood trim with mostly asian style furniture and bold splashes of red on the wall at the head of the bed and in a design pattern on the sheers.  fortunately the room had lots of full length windows and being a corner room, light from two sides, so the room was very bright and open in the daytime.  the room had a king size bed, a side glass topped work desk with chair, a coffee station with a nespresso machine, a kettle and a mini fridge underneath, a good sized closet with two bathrobes hanging inside, and a comfy red swivel chair in the corner from which to enjoy the harbour view.  there was also a large wall mounted tv facing the bed. the room also had a massive bathroom with full size free standing soaker bathtub, angled to face the harbour view (though not sure how i could enjoy the view from the bathtub since if i kept the blackout drapes open and closed only the sheers, i would also be looking at the residential building to my side across from the mira moon and the many occupants of the residential building).  there was also a separate shower, a large desk type vanity with a large but somewhat shallow sink on top facing a mirrored wall, and a separate cubicle for the toilet with a glass door.  the door to the bathroom was also mirrored on both sides which adds to the appearance of size and openness and, angled properly, allows me to see the tv from either the toilet or the sink.  there is a speaker system in the bathroom that can broadcast what the tv is viewing.  inside the room at the coffee station, there were 6 large 1.5 litre bottles of water and staff indicated i could request more water as needed.  also provided were two types of nespresso capsules – ispirazione firenze and vivalto lungo decaffeinato - and two types of tea bags – royal darjeeling and grand jasmine - and again, i could request more capsules or tea bags as needed.  in the bathroom, extra toiletries, toilet paper, tissue were placed in anticipation of the extended stay.  there was also a welcome tin of candies on the desk with a welcome note from the hotel.  also on the desk was a pack of 60 sheets of 75% alcohol wipes – a handy item which i used to clean the desk after meals.  beside the bed on a small round chinese style side table was an ipad mini preloaded with some apps that reported on the weather and accessed certain tv channels and pay movies.  the ipad mini was very old and its stand/cover was so worn that the ipad mini could not really be stood up in the cover stand.  i did not really find the ipad mini of much use during my stay. note that the hotel does not provide any ceramic cups, plates or cutlery inside the room.  instead, the coffee station drawer is equipped with some paper cups and very thin wood disposable cutlery is delivered with each meal (and wood chopsticks for chinese meals).  fortunately, i had brought my own ceramic mug and reusable travel fork and spoon having read articles on quarantining that suggest having such items might be comforting.  the thin wood disposable knife and fork were often not quite up to the job.  t he fork was not very sharp and had trouble stabbing into food items.  the knife was even less helpful – ok for cutting open the bread rolls and buttering them, but hopeless for use to cut any meat or even chicken items or for cutting the fruits provided with meals.  having experienced the use of the wood disposable cutlery the first couple of meals, i asked my family to drop off real metal cutlery for me.in order to make for easy cleaning and disinfection, all the light switches, phone handsets and the remote control were plastic wrapped.  this even extended to the pillows which were sealed in plastic bags and then the pillow cases were put on top.  this resulted in the pillows making some noise when you sleep on them.  i was not bothered by this and do understand that it is much easier just to change the pillow cases rather than try to clean the pillow itself, and this also gave me some comfort i was not making contact with a pillow that someone else in a quarantine stay made contact with.  however, i understand from other reviews on tripadvisor that others found it very vexing to sleep on noisy pillows.  i had a bit more issue with the plastic covered and wrapped controls as sometimes the wrap was affixed too tight such that light switches, phone or remote control would not work well as the buttons were not able to bounce back after being pressed, but it was an easy thing to fix just by pulling on the plastic wrap a bit to loosen it and pressing a couple more times.  the room appeared to be well cleaned and i did not spot any issues other than that the metal base of the red swivel chair did not appear to have been cleaned at all and was covered with dust. the most obvious missing item in the room is some kind of side table that could be used for meals and that could be positioned so that i could watch the tv while eating.  the only desk in the room faces the wall, is located to the side of the tv and cannot see the tv.  it is large and cannot be easily moved particularly since the rabbit shaped desk lamp affixed to the desk is plugged into an outlet in the wall.  i wanted to try to create a separate eating area on the other side of the room near the windows where the red swivel chair was located and from which i could see the tv.  there were two chinese style small round side tables beside the bed but they were too small to hold the meal containers and drink cups.  i initially contacted the virtual concierge through whatsapp to request a tray and perhaps an extra luggage stand to create my own side table but was told nothing was available.  luckily, about a week into my quarantine, i made contact with kevin ko, the assistant front office manager and he made extra efforts to find me options and ended up sourcing a black stool, a silver round side table and an extra plastic tray for me to consider.  i ended up using the silver round side table and tray to create my dining area for the rest of my quarantine.   all designated hotels are required to provide 3 meals a day to quarantine guests.  mira moon has a very strong food program with 3 choices for each of the three daily meals – a vegetarian option, a local touch option and an international option.  the hotel e-mailed the menu for my entire stay to me once i booked, together with a separate website link for ordering the meals for each day.  the menu is on a 2 week cycle and repeats after 14 days.  meal selections must be made 5 days in advance or else the hotel will select the meal choice for the guest.  meal service times are fixed – 8-9 am for breakfast, 12:30-1:30 pm for lunch and 6:30-7:30 for dinner.  most meals are delivered to my room within the first 15 min of the one hour time range for meal service and only twice did i have to call to inquire about meals – once when i first checked in and lunch was not delivered until i called front desk close to 2 pm and a second time on day 9 when i called at 8:55 am to inquire just as breakfast was delivered.  staff will sometimes knock and sometimes knock and ring the bell when delivering meals.  there were a couple of times when i might have not heard the knock and did not pick up my food until much later so it might be a good idea to periodically check outside the door at meal times if meals appear to be a bit late.  a few times during the quarantine, on days 15, 16 and 20, lunch came unexpectedly early by about 15 minutes around 12:15 pm.  i was worried about the quality and quantity of food since food is a frequent complaint in reviews about designated quarantine hotels so i did prepare by bringing lots of snacks with me and chose the mira moon to be close to family so that they can drop off items for me if needed.  my concern was completely unfounded as the food provided by mira moon was consistently plentiful and delicious.  eventhough i never selected the vegetarian option, i was also never short of vegetables as different vegetables were always included as part of lunch and dinner.  mira moon also provides a daily dessert with lunch and dinner each day.  most of the time the dessert would be a mini muffin of one of 4 flavours (green one matcha i guess, blueberry, lemon poppyseed and chocolate) but sometimes it would be a small piece of chocolate mousse cake or brownie and a few times it would be something completely different and new such as mini tapioca in coconut milk with blueberries and raspberry, almond jelly, or pineapple cake.  during the first week, no fruits were provided with meals but at the end of the first week, a small container of fruits (an apple, orange, kiwi, banana and some grapes) was delivered to my room together with a note from the hotel congratulating me on completing one week of quarantine.  starting in the second week, a fruit was included with each lunch – an apple, a pear or a banana.  at the end of the second week of quarantine, again there was a container delivered to my room with a note congratulating me on completing two weeks of quarantine and this time the treat was a traditional hong kong egg tart.  then on day 19 with 3 days to go in the quarantine, hotel sent up a card with a pack of lush bubble bath. in general, i found the local touch lunches and dinner tended to be smaller in portion size than the international ones but were still substantial and enough for me.  with breakfast, the local touch option tended to be the bigger meal since it was usually congee accompanied by a large serving of noodle of some kind.  i discovered after a few days that it was actually too much food to eat up everything that was provided since breads (buns, corn bread roll, mini croissants) were also provided with each international meal lunch and dinner.  the mini croissants were a favourite, so good i did not even need to

bone so be aware to be careful.  to give other potential quarantine stay guests a complete picture of what quarantine meals would be like at mira moon, i posted photos and a mini review of every meal

It started with reservations. I originally thought I would only do 7 days and due to the changes made by the government, I found I needed to do 21. The hotel made every effort to change my reservations from 7 to 21 days. I appreciated their efforts considering all that I read about people having difficulty booking their quarantine stay. Check - in was efficient and upon entering my room, I was pleasantly surprised with welcome gift from the hotel: soda, juice, instant noodle and snacks waiting for me. There is a Nespresso machine, refridgerator and hot water kettle in the room. The accommodations are well appointed with a bath tub, separate shower, desk and small dining table with  window banquette seating. The room was large enough to do my daily walking exercises, HIIT, and roll out the yoga mat. The bathroom shower and tub had great water pressure.I highly recommend the harbour view. Looking out of the window one did not feel confined. It was nice to watch the building in TST glow during sunset. Also it was nice to the activities on the harbour.The staff was attentive. I give the restaurant staff very high marks. The food was varied and selection was good. One orders through an app which is easy to use. Food came on time based on my requested times and was tasty. There were only a few meals out of 63 which were not to my liking. Portions were ample and I even requested to reduce the rice to half portion. During my stay the hotel asked me to fill in a survey to improve their service. I told them I wish I had fresh fruit every day. After that, every lunch I had a portion of fresh fruit. I told them that I often could not finish my meal but I had no way to reheat the food; within minutes a microwave was at my door.I was really worried how I would survive 21 days; but I did! The TV channels were only ok; but I had an HDMI cable and watched Netflix, Apple TV etc. The hotel can provide an HDMI cable is you don't have one. Even check out was easy. 30 minutes before my agreed check out time, someone came to take my bags down. Then just after midnight, staff came to bring me down to the lobby to check out.

I believe this is a newly opened hotel in Hong Kong and we were quite impressed with the overall service. Jeffrey Ang from the Concierge team was very helpful and helped us organized our airport pickup/ limousine service. He always responded to me through email promptly with his professional advise. Nowadays, travelling is kind of a hassle - especially you have those protective wear, mask and face shield to bring along apart from your bags. My family and I spent nearly 2 days to reach Hong Kong from the time we left home in Australia and later transited in Singapore. We were extremely exhausted with so many luggages and did not know how long the arrival process with the Covid test would take in the Airport. We called to the hotel right after we finished the whole process and reached the Arrival Hall. It was a lot earlier than expected. Kelvin Kwok from the Concierge team immediately helped us to make all the necessary arrangement and we got pick up within half an hour - we truly appreciated it! Patrick from the Airport Pickup team came to greet and help us with all the excess baggage (we got like 7 suitcases with so many bags - and all were really very heavy!). Many people might have their smile fade away but Patrick was so convivial and genuine. The chauffeur was also very helpful. Kelvin and his team met us and helped us to unload all the bags from the entrance to our room. Kelvin also escorted us throughout the entire arrival process and he was truly attentive. Jin from Reception helped us with the check-in process and it was efficient and seamless. The room was clean, nice and tidy which I think that is all that matters nowadays - only thing that I think it would be worth to look into is the toilet. As there was some stains from long time in the very bottom that can be seen when the blue plus detergents are gone. Guess it would be better to use some brush to get those clean properly in the very first place. We can tell it should be there since long so it was not a real big deal. As we were there for quarantine, throughout the whole stay, we mostly got food delivery from Deliveroo or FoodPanda and we also got quite a few stuff sent to the Hotel that we purchased online. The Concierge Team always helped to bring that up really swiftly - thank you so much! For Housekeeping service, there was an English speaking team member was very thoughtful, cheerful and worth to be recognised too - I’m sorry that we didn’t manage to get her name. Besides, the team that called to us daily to check our body temperature was also very friendly. Upon departure, we called down to the Reception twice as we wanted to get help for calling a taxi, as well as get a helping hand or even just a trolley for bringing the luggage down. There was a male team member answered us in rush, twice, but eventually forgot. We did mention to him that we were in a real hurry in the second call. I do understand that it could happen as that was peak hour for check-out (I do understand as myself also work in hotel industry, and particularly in Front Office too). It would be better if he tell the truth for how long it would take or advise it would be better for us to go down and get the trolley by ourselves. We eventually brought down all bags by ourselves. It was a bit hard to manage as we have a kid with us but not a problem. Michelle that we met on the ground floor assisted us with the bags and after confirmed that no taxi was called for us, she went above and beyond to go into the middle of the road, in order to help us get a taxi immediately; eventually we were just slightly late for our appointment but it could have gone more delay if we didn't have Michelle there. Thank you! We were overall happy with our stay regardless there were rooms for improvement that mentioned aforesaid. However, I would say that the service that we received were excellent. The hotel and the Front Office Manager is lucky to have so many great team members as its valuable asset.

This proved to be a highly fortunate choice. This hotel--previously the L'hotel--is in Wong Chuk Hang, and was an ideal location for us as it's close to our home. It has nicely big rooms, fastidiously cleaned, high-end linens...and fairly good pricing for such. The best part, though, was the service: their team consistently worked hard to make quarantine guests feel as comfortable as possible, and to accomodate our requests quickly and effectively. Some examples:=================- Their guest service center consistently fielded calls promptly and cheerfully, and accomodated our requests with a solid ""can-do"" attitude--everything from trivial ""please send more jugs of water"" to ""would you loan me a rolling office chair"". Excellent service.- They take pride in conveying any/all deliveries up to guest rooms quickly. This was so efficient that, when I'd ask our housekeeper to drop something off at the hotel, the hotel staff would typically drop the item by our front door and ring our doorbell BEFORE my housekeeper had the chance to chat me that she'd just left the items at the hotel. This efficiency was the case no matter the hour; I've since been told they do such delivery to rooms on a 24-hour basis. I cannot overstress that, when you're stuck in quarantine, having a hotel team that always answers the call, always tries to help, and does a stellar job in consistently passing deliveries promptly to guest rooms (any time), is of huge help to make one less ""trapped"". To me, these aspects of service are the most important hotel features in order to have a tolerable and productive experience while in quarantine. After our stay, the hotel GM was happy to have a chat about our experience, and to make note of the few minor things we noticed that could be improved. This willingness to listen to guests and to seek to improve further is another strongly positive sign.

The deliveries are brought to your room instantly and the room is very spacious. I was in a high floor hill view room and found it really peaceful. So relaxing to look out the window.

My experience at Nina Island South had unexpectedly turned out to be  a pleasure. The reception desk, the service centre and housekeeping staff were always attentive and responsive, bringing up food deliveries speedily without prompting and accommodating our changing meal selections without question. My room was clean with large bay windows and a generous space (at 300sf for a basic room) more than enough for my yoga mat and daily exercises. The bed was very comfortable with new mattresses and a satisfyingly hot strong shower. The free flow of fresh linen and distilled water on request, unexpected afternoon treats like cookies and beer were small but significant touches that made guests feel respected. Thank you, Nina Island South for making my quarantine days pass so quickly and comfortably.

I was there for 14 days with wife and 1 and 2 year old kids, with two interconnecting rooms, facing the country park. PricingNina is fairly priced and compared to other hotels I'd say it's pretty good value for money. There are some terrible quarantine hotels that aren't much cheaper than Nina and then there are your 5* places that are much more expensive, but not that much better. Cancellation policyThe cancellation policy is just one nights fee, which is fairer and again more reasonable than the majority. Also, if Gov policy changes, you're allowed to amend your booking accordingly.Booking flexibilityAs the Government continued to change the rules, our booking changed from 21 days to 14 days to 7 days and then unfortunately back up to 14 days. That last change came at a time when there were thousands of people needing to extend their quarantine bookings but Nina were great in being able to quickly update our booking - despite no doubt being overwhelmed with phone calls and their hotel already being full (like all quarantine hotels at this time). FoodCatering room service for 400 or so rooms must be quite a task, but they managed to delivery every meal hot. There are 5 or 6 different menus to choose from which rotate weekly and hotel are pretty flexible with switching choices if there's ever something you really can't/don't eat. Of course there are times when what it is on the menu isn't something you'd normally order, but if you're not a fussy eater all the food is fine.  We opted for 1 health and 1 halal menu. This would've been enough for 2 adults, but with the two kids eating it too we often needed to top up with our own snacks or the occassional Deliveroo. Hotel very quick to deliver the Deliveroo to your room once they receive it. Note that we did have the option to pay for extra meals for the kids but chose not to - the hotel were flexible in this regard. The room itselfSpacious for a HK hotel, a nice window sill that gives a bit of extra space, decent sized bath (for HK). Beds were OK; I didn't like the pillow but just asked for another and they brought one up. TV has the usual hotel channels and an HDMI port for connecting your laptop. Room isn't carpeted which was good for keeping it clean. Room also comes with cleaning utensils which are pretty essential when you have two young kids. The serviceIf you're not fussy, this doesn't usually matter. But when you are locked in a room for 2 weeks, it absolutely does! Basically you phone 0 and they answer straight away and the answer to all of our requests was always ""Yes"" and usually delivered in a few minutes. Ice. Wine bottle opener. New sheets. New Pillow. New towel. More snacks. Etc. Must be tough with 400 rooms making demands like this but at no point did they seem overwhelmed or unwilling. ExtrasOccassionally free snacks get delivered, activities delivered for the kids. You can rent exercise equipment. There is also a WhatsApp group for inmates to keep each other sane. I don't plan on doing quarantine again, but if I do, I'd go as far as saying I would be flexible with my flight dates to try and get a room at the Nina.",1,"dear valued guest,warmest greetings from nina hotel island south in hong kong!thank you so much for your encouraging 5 bullets review on us which has been a true motivation to all our team members. it is great to know that you are satisfied with our quarantine arrangement, hotel & room environment, and the services provided by our teammates. it is always our firm believe to go extra mile in order to provide a homely comfort staying experience to all our guests, your compliment is of utmost important and great motivation to all our teammates.we look forward to welcoming you back many times in the future!best regards,cissy choigeneral managernina hotel island south","Responded September 6, 2021","the best place to do quarantine - especially with a family nobody ever chooses to do hotel quarantine but if you have to, i highly recommend nina. i was there for 14 days with wife and 1 and 2 year old kids, with two interconnecting rooms, facing the country park. pricingnina is fairly priced and compared to other hotels i'd say it's pretty good value for money. there are some terrible quarantine hotels that aren't much cheaper than nina and then there are your 5* places that are much more expensive, but not that much better. cancellation policythe cancellation policy is just one nights fee, which is fairer and again more reasonable than the majority. also, if gov policy changes, you're allowed to amend your booking accordingly.booking flexibilityas the government continued to change the rules, our booking changed from 21 days to 14 days to 7 days and then unfortunately back up to 14 days. that last change came at a time when there were thousands of people needing to extend their quarantine bookings but nina were great in being able to quickly update our booking - despite no doubt being overwhelmed with phone calls and their hotel already being full (like all quarantine hotels at this time). foodcatering room service for 400 or so rooms must be quite a task, but they managed to delivery every meal hot. there are 5 or 6 different menus to choose from which rotate weekly and hotel are pretty flexible with switching choices if there's ever something you really can't/don't eat. of course there are times when what it is on the menu isn't something you'd normally order, but if you're not a fussy eater all the food is fine.  we opted for 1 health and 1 halal menu. this would've been enough for 2 adults, but with the two kids eating it too we often needed to top up with our own snacks or the occassional deliveroo. hotel very quick to deliver the deliveroo to your room once they receive it. note that we did have the option to pay for extra meals for the kids but chose not to - the hotel were flexible in this regard. the room itselfspacious for a hk hotel, a nice window sill that gives a bit of extra space, decent sized bath (for hk). beds were ok; i didn't like the pillow but just asked for another and they brought one up. tv has the usual hotel channels and an hdmi port for connecting your laptop. room isn't carpeted which was good for keeping it clean. room also comes with cleaning utensils which are pretty essential when you have two young kids. the serviceif you're not fussy, this doesn't usually matter. but when you are locked in a room for 2 weeks, it absolutely does! basically you phone 0 and they answer straight away and the answer to all of our requests was always ""yes"" and usually delivered in a few minutes. ice. wine bottle opener. new sheets. new pillow. new towel. more snacks. etc. must be tough with 400 rooms making demands like this but at no point did they seem overwhelmed or unwilling. extrasoccassionally free snacks get delivered, activities delivered for the kids. you can rent exercise equipment. there is also a whatsapp group for inmates to keep each other sane. i don't plan on doing quarantine again, but if i do, i'd go as far as saying i would be flexible with my flight dates to try and get a room at the nina.",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

I'm very extroverted, love the outdoors, being active, and cooking. So, I was prepared for a challenging 2 weeks. I'm now on Day 13, and can say that Nina Hotel made the experience not only bearable but actually fun and exciting! I absolutely LOVE my room, which is a standard King on the 22nd floor with insane views of the city. The room is very spacious, especially for Hong Kong. I moved some of the furniture to create even more space, and on some days I've managed to walk 7-8k steps (without a treadmill! just dancing and walking around). I particularly love sitting by the windows, reading a book or having a meal, as well as taking relaxing baths. I'm vegetarian, and have been mostly eating from the vegan menu but will occasionally switch a meal to the vegetarian menu. Whenever I call to switch, the hotel has been very accommodating. A lot of people complain about food in quarantine, but I find it quite good, especially when I add my own seasonings (salt, pepper, chili). Every now and then the hotel also sends additional treats which are such a nice surprise and keep my days fun and different. The hotel also provides some activities, such as mazes, find the difference games, etc. And Friday happy hour is always a fun time, with the hotel providing us with drinks and snacks, and guests join on a zoom call to connect -- this helps so much with not feeling alone. The staff is incredibly helpful and kind, when I open the door to pick up my food, sometimes a staff member will be walking through and always greets me warmly. I've called the service desk for a number of things, such as asking for a bathrobe, dehumidifier, extra towels, extra water, plates and bowls, salt and pepper, etc. and they are SO fast in providing what I need.

A friend had stayed in Jan 2021 and was very happy here. I had stayed at another hotel in January and it suited my needs at the time. This time I chose Nina based on size, price, food and service, not necessarily in that order.  So far Nina has not disappointed. The Guest Engagement Team (Tiffany, Marco, Jay, Johnny, Fannie and others) have been very accommodating with our requests, deliveries etc. The food so far has been quite good, and filling so really no need to pack so many snacks… I may have over packed if anything.

It has been a very comfortable stay that flew by quickly. The RoomThe view of the Hill Side room was amazing, the greeneries calmed me down and gave me a sense of peace. It’s facing the west side so you can watch the sunset from here. It’s almost like a staycation/retreat for me. The room was really spacious, relatively bigger than normal HK hotels. It was relatively quiet, the walls do a good job at sound insulation, you won’t be able to hear any noise coming from other rooms. The bathroom was nice and spacious with a shower/tub. Like previous reviews, I confirm that the flush button is hard to press, and you may have to press it several times. But not a big issue. Despite being on the 25th floor, the hot water pressure from the shower was strong, you can adjust the air conditioning, it kept my room nice and cool despite the heat of the summer. Since I have to work during my stay, I requested for a working desk and chair with a back panel in advance. Do note that employees are not allowed to go inside your room, so make sure you make this request in advance. The room has a mini fridge and water boiler, and a drawer filled with coffee and tea. They have a tv with the basic local channels as well as some international news channels. The ServiceI really commend the staff for their speedy and efficient response to all my request, they have a Whatsapp account that you can contact. They were able to solve and address my issues quickly and were polite and nice in every interaction. The phone in my room broke down and they sent me a HK sim card to make local calls. During my stay, there was a confirmed COVID case in the hotel (this was unavoidable and could happen to any hotels, even Mandarin Oriental) I texted the hotel about my concern and they reassured me that they arranged for contractors to disinfect all public areas including elevators and corridors and made sure air purifiers are set up. This was an isolated case and there wasn’t another COVID case since then. This attests that the hotel was able to control and prevent an outbreak from happening. Really appreciate them for keeping us safe during these risky times. Small TouchesThere was a welcome package waiting for me upon my arrival. It was a pleasant surprise with drinks, snacks, a mug and your own set of reusable utensils. They also have extra sheets as well as all the cleaning tools imaginable sanitary wipes, Lysol spray, gloves, toilet cleaner, dust sweeper and paper towels. It was really thoughtful of the hotel to have all these prepared for the room. 2 jugs of Watsons’ mineral water are provided, you can request for more without charge. I loved the snacks that they would drop off on random days- such as rice dumplings during Tuen Ng festival, sugar cane juice and malai gou. Once a week- they would also send games/puzzles, which I find amusing. The FoodThere are 4 menus that you can choose from- the standard menu,  healthy menu, vegetarian menu, halal menu. By default, you are assigned the Standard menu upon arrival, you need to stick to it for 1 week, and then change thereafter. I then switched to the Healthy menu after a week, I texted them in before lunch and they were able to switch it for my dinner. The Standard menu is similar to what you’d have in a typical Cha-chan teng, meat dish with rice and a side of vegetable. Lunch comes with a piece of fruit. Hope that they could serve fruit for dinner too. Breakfast is a little repetitive but it’s fine. Quantity is sufficient. I do like the quality of their rice (sorry, random comment). For the healthy menu- the salad is really fresh. It gives you some variety too (not salads all the time), sometimes you’d have wraps, salmon, potatoes, risotto, etc… the quality is there, I’d say it’s even better than the Standard menu, but choose at your own risk, if you have a bigger appetite, go for the Standard one. They allow outside food delivery as well and would bring them up to your room. There is a small stool outside of every room where they drop off your food- no contact delivery.",1,"dear valued guest,warmest greetings from nina hotel island south in hong kong!thank you so much for your encouraging 5 bullets review on us which has been a true motivation to all our team members. it is great to know that you are satisfied with our hotel environment, quarantine arrangement and services provided. we shall definitely share with the team, in order to excel ourselves further.we look forward to welcoming you back many times in the future!best regards,cissy choigeneral managernina hotel island south","Responded June 17, 2021","super comfortable, peaceful quarantine staycation. today is the last day of my 14-day quarantine stay with nina hotel island south. it has been a very comfortable stay that flew by quickly. the roomthe view of the hill side room was amazing, the greeneries calmed me down and gave me a sense of peace. it’s facing the west side so you can watch the sunset from here. it’s almost like a staycation/retreat for me. the room was really spacious, relatively bigger than normal hk hotels. it was relatively quiet, the walls do a good job at sound insulation, you won’t be able to hear any noise coming from other rooms. the bathroom was nice and spacious with a shower/tub. like previous reviews, i confirm that the flush button is hard to press, and you may have to press it several times. but not a big issue. despite being on the 25th floor, the hot water pressure from the shower was strong, you can adjust the air conditioning, it kept my room nice and cool despite the heat of the summer. since i have to work during my stay, i requested for a working desk and chair with a back panel in advance. do note that employees are not allowed to go inside your room, so make sure you make this request in advance. the room has a mini fridge and water boiler, and a drawer filled with coffee and tea. they have a tv with the basic local channels as well as some international news channels. the servicei really commend the staff for their speedy and efficient response to all my request, they have a whatsapp account that you can contact. they were able to solve and address my issues quickly and were polite and nice in every interaction. the phone in my room broke down and they sent me a hk sim card to make local calls. during my stay, there was a confirmed covid case in the hotel (this was unavoidable and could happen to any hotels, even mandarin oriental) i texted the hotel about my concern and they reassured me that they arranged for contractors to disinfect all public areas including elevators and corridors and made sure air purifiers are set up. this was an isolated case and there wasn’t another covid case since then. this attests that the hotel was able to control and prevent an outbreak from happening. really appreciate them for keeping us safe during these risky times. small touchesthere was a welcome package waiting for me upon my arrival. it was a pleasant surprise with drinks, snacks, a mug and your own set of reusable utensils. they also have extra sheets as well as all the cleaning tools imaginable sanitary wipes, lysol spray, gloves, toilet cleaner, dust sweeper and paper towels. it was really thoughtful of the hotel to have all these prepared for the room. 2 jugs of watsons’ mineral water are provided, you can request for more without charge. i loved the snacks that they would drop off on random days- such as rice dumplings during tuen ng festival, sugar cane juice and malai gou. once a week- they would also send games/puzzles, which i find amusing. the foodthere are 4 menus that you can choose from- the standard menu,  healthy menu, vegetarian menu, halal menu. by default, you are assigned the standard menu upon arrival, you need to stick to it for 1 week, and then change thereafter. i then switched to the healthy menu after a week, i texted them in before lunch and they were able to switch it for my dinner. the standard menu is similar to what you’d have in a typical cha-chan teng, meat dish with rice and a side of vegetable. lunch comes with a piece of fruit. hope that they could serve fruit for dinner too. breakfast is a little repetitive but it’s fine. quantity is sufficient. i do like the quality of their rice (sorry, random comment). for the healthy menu- the salad is really fresh. it gives you some variety too (not salads all the time), sometimes you’d have wraps, salmon, potatoes, risotto, etc… the quality is there, i’d say it’s even better than the standard menu, but choose at your own risk, if you have a bigger appetite, go for the standard one. they allow outside food delivery as well and would bring them up to your room. there is a small stool outside of every room where they drop off your food- no contact delivery.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

It is so hard deciding where to do your quarantine but I would highly recommend this hotel and the fabulous service they provide.Room view:I am in a city view room and on the 32nd floor: the room is spacious, bright and has an interesting view. For me having decent light is super important so I am delighted by the big windows and so much natural light (the blackout curtains work very well so you also get a good night's sleep). The view is not especially 'pretty' but it is open, I can see the top of the Ocean Park hill above a couple of office buildings and can even see a couple of cable cars! Through a gap in some other buildings I can see the entrance to Ocean Park and beyond that Aberdeen and the water. At night this is all lit up and is pretty. When you are in quarantine having an interesting, open view where you can see life going on, people, cars, boats etc makes a big difference. So big tick for location.Room size etc:Apparently it is 30sqm - my room has a ginormous double bed but there is still lots of room and space (I think they have removed some furniture). I do not like cramped spaces, but as I live in Hong Kong I am used to a smallish living environment but this room feels big and airy. There is a large open area in front of the windows where you could easily put an exercise bike/treadmill and a small work table and you would not feel cramped. My friends have leant me a folding table which is perfect for working/eating in the window bay. The window bay also has a wide sill, which is a nice alternative place to sit and chill out (pillows from the bed make it comfier!)There is a built-in glass 'desk' area under the tv, which is wide enough to eat or work at. There is a stool on wheels, no office chair (but I believe you can ask for one). The only other chair in the room is what I call the Bond villain chair, but it is quite comfy (and swivels!) and I use it to work from and it is ok. The fridge is the typical mini-fridge size but it works really well and keeps food cold. There is also a pull out storage area which has tea/coffee in it.There is a decent amount of storage space  (wardrobe, a low cupboard and a deep draw). The bathroom is spacious and the water pressure/temperature is great. FoodThe food is great and is far above my expectation. The portions are very generous (in fact sometimes too much) and the food is very tasty sometimes delicious! It is  fresh and well cooked. I have chosen to be on the 'healthy' menu and am really happy with it - I do sometimes add my own seasoning and flavours (such as chilli oil or mixed herbs) purely for my own taste. I have been particularly impressed by the fact that you get a really good portion of vegetables which are perfectly cooked (not mushy and not too hard). The Service:The 'Guest Engagement Team' (Marco, Jay, Johnny and Fannie) are great! They are friendly and responsive to all queries and problems. They are also very understanding of how difficult it is to do 21 days in seclusion and are doing a fabulous job of providing little treats/presents, games and activities: eg. over the Easter weekend we got origami paper and instructions, craft package of paints and an ornamental egg, an Easter cup cake, a sudoku puzzle. Each 'treat' is accompanied by a note - it is amazing how much excitement you feel when you hear the room door bell and then find on the table outside a small challenge or gift.Deliveries from friends/family or shops/food delivery services are all accepted and come to your door promptly.I would highly recommend this hotel and fully intend to support them by recommending to all my friends and I would not hesitate to come here as a non-quarantine guest too.",1,"dear valued guest,thank you for your valuable time in writing a review on us!it is so delighted to learn that you had a nice quarantine experience during your stay and you are satisfied with our hotel environment and food provided, your kind words on our teammates is highly appreciated. it is always our firm believe to go extra mile in order to provide a homely comfort staying experience to all our guests, your compliment is of utmost important and great motivation to all our teammates.we look forward to welcoming you back many times in the future!best regards,cissy choigeneral managernina hotel island south","Responded April 8, 2021","highly recommend as quarantine hotel! this is day 6 of my quarantine time in the nina hotel and i am so pleased that i chose to do my 21 days of quarantine here. it is so hard deciding where to do your quarantine but i would highly recommend this hotel and the fabulous service they provide.room view:i am in a city view room and on the 32nd floor: the room is spacious, bright and has an interesting view. for me having decent light is super important so i am delighted by the big windows and so much natural light (the blackout curtains work very well so you also get a good night's sleep). the view is not especially 'pretty' but it is open, i can see the top of the ocean park hill above a couple of office buildings and can even see a couple of cable cars! through a gap in some other buildings i can see the entrance to ocean park and beyond that aberdeen and the water. at night this is all lit up and is pretty. when you are in quarantine having an interesting, open view where you can see life going on, people, cars, boats etc makes a big difference. so big tick for location.room size etc:apparently it is 30sqm - my room has a ginormous double bed but there is still lots of room and space (i think they have removed some furniture). i do not like cramped spaces, but as i live in hong kong i am used to a smallish living environment but this room feels big and airy. there is a large open area in front of the windows where you could easily put an exercise bike/treadmill and a small work table and you would not feel cramped. my friends have leant me a folding table which is perfect for working/eating in the window bay. the window bay also has a wide sill, which is a nice alternative place to sit and chill out (pillows from the bed make it comfier!)there is a built-in glass 'desk' area under the tv, which is wide enough to eat or work at. there is a stool on wheels, no office chair (but i believe you can ask for one). the only other chair in the room is what i call the bond villain chair, but it is quite comfy (and swivels!) and i use it to work from and it is ok. the fridge is the typical mini-fridge size but it works really well and keeps food cold. there is also a pull out storage area which has tea/coffee in it.there is a decent amount of storage space  (wardrobe, a low cupboard and a deep draw). the bathroom is spacious and the water pressure/temperature is great. foodthe food is great and is far above my expectation. the portions are very generous (in fact sometimes too much) and the food is very tasty sometimes delicious! it is  fresh and well cooked. i have chosen to be on the 'healthy' menu and am really happy with it - i do sometimes add my own seasoning and flavours (such as chilli oil or mixed herbs) purely for my own taste. i have been particularly impressed by the fact that you get a really good portion of vegetables which are perfectly cooked (not mushy and not too hard). the service:the 'guest engagement team' (marco, jay, johnny and fannie) are great! they are friendly and responsive to all queries and problems. they are also very understanding of how difficult it is to do 21 days in seclusion and are doing a fabulous job of providing little treats/presents, games and activities: eg. over the easter weekend we got origami paper and instructions, craft package of paints and an ornamental egg, an easter cup cake, a sudoku puzzle. each 'treat' is accompanied by a note - it is amazing how much excitement you feel when you hear the room door bell and then find on the table outside a small challenge or gift.deliveries from friends/family or shops/food delivery services are all accepted and come to your door promptly.i would highly recommend this hotel and fully intend to support them by recommending to all my friends and i would not hesitate to come here as a non-quarantine guest too.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,,

In comparison to other Q hotels, I think where Nina stands out is the size of the room/price, quality of food, great social and support network (PM directly if you want to connect to the group), and excellent service/staff. 1. Room size and layout is critical because one needs to move around, exercise and work in quarantine. Note that mountain side rooms have slightly larger window space which can be useful for workouts, storage and personal spa :P 2. There are several food menus (also try to understand different needs like vegan/gluten free etc) and having variety is so needed when one is there for 21days. Food delivery is also available and Pandamart delivery is amazingly fast (average 5-7mins) so basic needs like snacks, drinks all easy to access3. Working can be challenging as room table isnt very ergonomically suitable. Ask for a different chair/table. They may be able to give you one. 4. Laundry - Another challenge for all in quarantine. Hotel can provide detergent and hangers. If you book early, you can borrow a dehumidifier (note that numbers are limited so ask well in advance. This is a lifesaver) 5. Hotel rents out bikes but also allowed me to bring in my own treadmill/walking pad. This is another life saver in quarantine. This is why a larger room in quarantine is so important. You need space for workout. 6. Whenever I needed something, I could always count on the Guest engagement team (Marco, Jay, Johnny and Fannie). You guys are awesome. The beers and snacks for our happy hours on Fridays really made the stay enjoyable.",1,"dear valued guest,warmest greetings from nina hotel island south in hong kong!thank you so much for your encouraging 5 bullets review on us which has been a true motivation to all our team members. it is great to know that you had an enjoyable quarantine stay with us, and that you are satisfied with our room environment, services provided. your compliment on our teammates are also highly appreciated. we shall definitely share with the team, in order to excel ourselves further.we look forward to welcoming you back many times in the future!best regards,cissy choigeneral managernina hotel island south","Responded March 26, 2021","fun and enjoyable 21 day q stay nina hotel is an excellent choice for quarantine. in comparison to other q hotels, i think where nina stands out is the size of the room/price, quality of food, great social and support network (pm directly if you want to connect to the group), and excellent service/staff. 1. room size and layout is critical because one needs to move around, exercise and work in quarantine. note that mountain side rooms have slightly larger window space which can be useful for workouts, storage and personal spa :p 2. there are several food menus (also try to understand different needs like vegan/gluten free etc) and having variety is so needed when one is there for 21days. food delivery is also available and pandamart delivery is amazingly fast (average 5-7mins) so basic needs like snacks, drinks all easy to access3. working can be challenging as room table isnt very ergonomically suitable. ask for a different chair/table. they may be able to give you one. 4. laundry - another challenge for all in quarantine. hotel can provide detergent and hangers. if you book early, you can borrow a dehumidifier (note that numbers are limited so ask well in advance. this is a lifesaver) 5. hotel rents out bikes but also allowed me to bring in my own treadmill/walking pad. this is another life saver in quarantine. this is why a larger room in quarantine is so important. you need space for workout. 6. whenever i needed something, i could always count on the guest engagement team (marco, jay, johnny and fannie). you guys are awesome. the beers and snacks for our happy hours on fridays really made the stay enjoyable.",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

To begin with, everything was so well thought off,  sanitizing wipes, disinfectant spray, kitchen towels and an overwhelming amount of disposable toilet brushes, trash bags, toilet supplies... 5 tissue boxes and 11 rows of toilet paper (we all know its unnecessary but it does give you a sense of security. You tell me! asian moms!) Staffs were extremely helpful and friendly. I booked my flight to Hong Kong two days prior to departure and they arranged everything to accommodate my needs. Got a credit card problem, and they allowed time for me to address the problem. All of the above demonstrated a high standard of professionalism in the staff members and their willingness to make their guests happy. Rooms are the size of a suite when compared to other hotels in Hong Kong (I've never lived in a hotel in Hong Kong but I would imagine it be a struggle as I have mild claustrophobia - I feels sick in a confined space.) Higher floors are dead quiet, I have trouble hearing anyways apart from my own breathing and the occasional sports cars going in/out shouson hill. Like always, there are room for improvements but for the price I don't think it's fair to complaint too much, just something you should look out for when you decide this as your quarantine home. Below is the honest feedback  on my stay so far:Goods: - Everything mentioned above...- Fast delivery speed (1 min lobby to room.)- Wifi speed is fast relative to other hotels (~45Mbs)- Refrigerator in room, I have mine filled with puddings first day :)*Food is meh, but I believe it's well above par for QUARANTINE MEALS.Bads:- Slight smell of cigarette in a non-smoking room. (#2808)- Presumably rusty water pipes? Water was yellow/brown for the first minute of my shower, ran a full tub after that and it was clear. My advise is, don't drink from the tap!Note that this is not a 5/6 star luxury hotel, but the comfortable setting/atmosphere will remind you of being home. Provided the excellent value, this should be the go-to hotel for anyone's 21 days quarantine.

I chose this hotel even if it is quite remote because of its relatively larger rooms of their City View Room (about 300 square feet). PROS:- Larger rooms compared to other hotels in a similar price range/hotel category (3.5 or 4 star hotel range); this hotel has a room size of 300 square feet whereas typically, other hotels only have a room size of 200 square feet. -- LOVE this!- Quick delivery to the rooms of food and package delivery -- LOVE this!- Provided sufficient cleaning items as hotel housekeeping/laundry services are suspended- Clean room- Bath tub -- LOVE this!CONS:- Customer service is a hit or miss. I have contacted the hotel a few times and interacted with marketing, front desk and guest services on the phone. And about 50% of the time, the tone of the person I am speaking with sounded impatient or in a hurry. I sense a lack of empathy to understand client needs. - I requested for a room with a view of the mountain during check in but I was told by front desk that if I wanted a mountain view room, I would need to pay 100/200 HKD  extra per night for that room category. I am already staying with you for 21 long days and this request cannot even be considered? I understand that I booked for a City View Room but it seems the aim of this hotel is to simply meet client expectations but not to exceed it. - This hotel does not provide hair conditioners, which is a basic bathroom toiletry. I asked for it and was told they don't provide it. - Hotel offer of a cycling machine is not available. They advertise something they cannot deliver.- Does not provide a diffuser to help an improved room smell.- Food is very average. I had to buy XO sauce and Maggi seasoning to help enhance flavor of the food. Would be nice if guests would be asked for some level of customization in terms of minor items such as what type of soda a guest prefers or if they want a fruit included in their meals. The fruits included in my meals mostly go to waste. I am not consuming drinking my sodas because its high sugar content. The hotel has a low-calorie meal plan and they serve Coke as an accompanying beverage!- TV is definitely old and very dated. Over-all, given demand for rooms (HK residents returning to HK from their holidays trips) exceed supply (there are only 36 designated quarantine hotels in Hong Kong), I would still have chosen to stay here given value for money and the room size. But I would not really be excited to recommend this hotel, given its service, under normal circumstances.I wish the hotel would be more than willing to go out of its way to truly listen to customer feedback and really figure out a way to professionally address customer needs and concerns.

There is more than enough space for a yoga mat, plus even an exercise bike. Enjoy your quiet time watching the planes take off  occassionally but not bothered by any airport noise.Food is more or less same as the other hotel. However many times I had to call front desk to enquire about my food not showing up (one time even after 8:10 pm, although dinner is supposed to be served from 6-8pm) In view of guest safety and to decrease the chance of cross-contimination in nearyby rooms in the same corridor, I have these to suggest to the hotel:(1) At check in, we were told the staff would knock at our door when they delivery our meals. However,  the food delivery time can be two hours long for each meal, (Breakfast: 6-8pm, lunch 12-2pm, dinner 6-8pm). Please make sure the delivery staff do knock at the door in inform the guest inside. In the past few days for so many meals I received, only occassionally would the staff actually knock at the door. Most of the time, especially the evening delivery, either they just walk away to the rooms, or just quietly speak in a very soft voice to tell the guest inside.This seems a trivial act. However, it can lead to more serious consequences.Imagine you have been expecting the meal for a while so a few times, guests including myself actually opened the door a few times only to find nothing has been delivered yet.This unnecessary opening the doors highly increases the chance of cross contimination. i have seen one staff using a very smart tool to help knocking at the door without touching the door. They use a long stick to knock which is as efficient.And of course, most the time, the food, especially the rice, is already cold.  And one time my long expected glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in lotus leaf, were soaked in congee accidentally spilled into a different compartment in the food box. Another time even the menu indicated soup, we were only offered a bottle of water, which we already have a lot in the room.So I highly suggest you bring more snacks, fruits, or dried fruit. I actually have packs of dried instant noodles and a good thermal flask to make my own cup noodles. (This is not cooking which is not allowed in the room)  Of course, you can also order hotel room serivce which is quite expensive if you are not on a company expense account: e.g. Fried Rice, hkd 168 plus 10pc, Grilled Rib Eye Steak hkd 398 plus 10pc (details see photos)(2) As I checked in the hotel, I noticed there were only two air filter machines on my floor,  which is defintely not enough in a fully booked quarantine hotel. I hope now more machines are added to all the floors to maintain a clean air environment in the corridor, especailly everyday, certain number of guests have to open the room door and take off their masks for further tests conducted by designated medical staff. Front desk staff please also remind guests at check in, for their own safety, and to prevent cross contimination, to wear proper masks when opening their room door for picking up food and taking out garbage.(3) Housekeeping and Front desk have been very friendly and efficient to refill whatever supplies I need.

Space enough to create a “play area” for my 2yr old and we were lucky enough to be given an airport view, so could watch planes come&go and a lovely sunset each evening. We managed to create a “dining room” set up on the desk and had mealtimes seated together. Unfortunately kids under 3 don’t get food (standard policy at all the hotels I looked into) so one has to think about nourishing toddlers. Got a cake for my sons birthday from the hotel, thank you for the special surprise. Response to requests very promptly attended to, extra towels, bedding and vacuum cleaner given without any issues. Friendly staff all around. Checkin, checkout and on the phone. I’m not sure if it is mentioned anywhere, I didn’t look for any reference but the hotel only has feather bedding, if you have any sensitivity to it, you won’t get much option other than to dump all the bedding and sleep on just a sheet, with no pillow. We did eventually manage to get some grey fleece type blanket and put it in a duvet cover. Food was fine for a non-picky eater. And home cooked deliveries really easy (don’t know about takeout deliveries, didn’t try). My wifi was quite terrible for 3 of the 14days.

My deluxe room on the eighth floor was large with an open, bright courtyard view, so not claustrophobic. Room views will vary according to the price and orientation, so if possible check before you arrive. The room had blackout curtains, and was quiet, with only occasional noise intrusion from the corridor. The room was clean on arrival, although it did not give the impression of being fresh and sanitized, as I would expect, particularly for a long quarantine stay.The bed and bed linen were of good quality and were clean and comfortable. with good beside and room lighting. There was a sofa, a small table, and a wall-mounted desk running a third of the length of the room. There was a small fridge. and kettle for making tea and instant coffee, sachets of which were provided. Also in the room on arrival were 25 small plastic bottles of distilled water for the 21-day stint. Any further water was chargeable, or from the tap. The room had a good-sized 40 inch TV with 50 or so channels.The bathroom was compact with a small bath and a strong shower. Basic shower gel, shampoo, and soap were provided. There was a hairdryer. Good quality towels were provided.On the food side, three meals a day from a setlist were set down on a seat outside the door within predetermined ranges of time. A knock on the door indicating it had arrived. The food was OK for the price paid, portions were small, often served lukewarm, but were adequate The food types were not always to my liking, and I was not offered a choice of menu. I reheated the food, and also supplemented the food provided by ordering from Park and Shop online. Had I not done so I would have gone pretty hungry at times. Sadly, the meals were delivered in a plastic bag, in a plastic lunchbox with a plastic lid with plastic utensils, also in another plastic bag. Typically there would be up to 10 plastic items PER MEAL, or 500-600 throwaway plastic items per 21-day quarantine. With quarantine provisions set to continue for months in Hong Kong, would it not be possible for the hotel to organize a choice of washable plates and cutlery?On the audiovisual side, the systems in place seemed dated. The hotel TV had an HDMI socket for linking to a laptop but I found it very difficult to stream either live or recorded programs due to very slow and intermittent internet speeds. This also from time to time affected WhatsApp calls and internet connectivity on my phone and laptop. This was s source of frustration since in a lockdown the tv and internet become the main sources of entertainment and contact with the outside world during a long stay in a single room. I did complain on several occasions, but there was no discernable improvement. Whilst I appreciate internet usage rates would be high, with virtually all rooms occupied during quarantine, the hotel has had months to bring this to improve the standard for the benefit of its guests.Finally with regard to guest communication, which is particularly important since during hotel quarantine you are not permitted to leave the room for the entire duration of your stay. Guest-hotel communication is therefore only possible through the hotel phone system. However, most of the features of the telephone comms system seem to have been disabled. Calls so far as I could find out are all routed through the operator who may in my experience take several minutes to answer calls, presumably because so many others are calling. Staff are however polite when responding, but in an emergency difficulty in contacting staff could become a serious issue.Information provided to guests is poor with very few details provided on arrival, no welcome message or courtesy calls to find out how guests are coping with the hotel confinement, or if they have any special requirements. No messages from the manager or staff. There are no events or special menus organised by the hotel to make the stay more pleasant. Communication with guests or between guests is seemingly not encouraged by the hotel.

The hotel has been built probably with the opening of the airport (20+ years ago) and needs a refresh. The booking process is straightforward, it took me 5 minutes, and I did it all online. The T&C are not in customer favors ""No cancellation and amendment is allowed once the reservation is confirmed"" and payment in full at booking time. When you start your stay, you will get a Chinese menu. You can change it to Western (that is the same as Chinese but with spaghetti instead of rice), Vegetarian, or Halal (that seems to be the best option, even if I did not try). You can also select a mixed menu (e.g., Vegetarian for breakfast, Western for lunch, and Chinese for dinner). I changed my menu during my stay calling the room service; they been very gentle, fast, and accommodating. It depends on tastes, but I judge the food as not eatable on most occasions. You can order using the delivery APP, and the stuff has been delivered to my room very fast. One day, I also ordered room service: it was ok and took 1 hour to be delivered. The checkout process is simple and fast: someone comes to pick you up at your room (the lifts are blocked), and you are taking different lifts from when you arrived. On the second floor, there is a gentleman that scans your quarantine order and you can go. Staff are all very nice and professional.Room reviewThe room assigned to me was a so-called Deluxe Room, 29 sqmt. However, I doubt that room was really 29 sqmt: the hotel is built as a square, and my room was in one corner, so the two main walls were not parallel, which came out with a significant reduction in space. That, however, is the less of the issues. The room is old, and the carpet is over any reasonable level of hygiene: I founded nails and long hairs from previous guests. I believe the housekeeping disinfect the carpet with spray (it was unbelievably sticky, especially during the first days) between one guest and another but I doubt they clean with a vacuum cleaner. The bathroom was very smelly. The room is not well furnished with too many amenities: tissue boxes, two toilet paper rolls, few towels (3 for the body and 3 for hands, two sleepers, one hairdryer), and two shampoos and two bath gels. There is a small pack of detergent powder for laundry. They provide two coffee cups, two spoons, one water boiler, few instant coffees, English breakfast tea, and sugars. There is one small fridge but working well. There are 30 bottles of water, and if you want more, it cost 5$ each bottle. There is a large Sony TV (that is not smart) with an HDMI port, and you need to remember to bring an HDMI cable with you. There is a good selection of international channels (from Australia, US, HK, Japan, France, GCC, Mainland, UK, India, Korea). Internet is quite good and easy to connect. I had a queen bed with a 3 cm topper, a round glass table, a sofa. All around one of the walls, there is a long table where you can comfortably work. The windows are locked, small, and have a monotonous view of the pool. Lighting is adequate, while AC is noisy and old. Suggestions to ManagementI was aware the food in this hotel was not good, and I came ready for that. But what surprised me was the missing of basic hygiene in the room. If I understood – not justify – few long hairs can remain on the carpet, having long hairs on a fresh new towel, or nails on the floor is not acceptable. Since this hotel is providing a service for the community that is intended to stop the diffusion of a disease, I wonder why we should remain confined in such an environment. As a takeover from this stay, I am not sure I will remember the stench coming from the bathroom or the carpets' hairs/nails.",1,"dear guest, greetings from the regal airport hotel! thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us during your recent stay.whilst we are delighted to read that your overall experience from the staff being efficient, responsive and accommodating, to the overall booking process and the choices of tv channels, is positive. we are disappointed to learn of the challenges you encountered in terms of room conditions, carpet cleanliness and air-conditioning noise. please accept our sincere apologies for the lapse you were subjected to and rest assured that your comments have been brought up in our internal meetings for immediate remedial action.we sincerely hope the incident has not marred your impression of our hotel.  all of us look forward to serving you again at the regal airport hotel. with warm regards from the asia's most exciting city!yours sincerelyjohn a girard general manager","Responded September 26, 2021","quarantine stay: avoid! i stayed in a deluxe room. the hotel has been built probably with the opening of the airport (20+ years ago) and needs a refresh. the booking process is straightforward, it took me 5 minutes, and i did it all online. the t&c are not in customer favors ""no cancellation and amendment is allowed once the reservation is confirmed"" and payment in full at booking time. when you start your stay, you will get a chinese menu. you can change it to western (that is the same as chinese but with spaghetti instead of rice), vegetarian, or halal (that seems to be the best option, even if i did not try). you can also select a mixed menu (e.g., vegetarian for breakfast, western for lunch, and chinese for dinner). i changed my menu during my stay calling the room service; they been very gentle, fast, and accommodating. it depends on tastes, but i judge the food as not eatable on most occasions. you can order using the delivery app, and the stuff has been delivered to my room very fast. one day, i also ordered room service: it was ok and took 1 hour to be delivered. the checkout process is simple and fast: someone comes to pick you up at your room (the lifts are blocked), and you are taking different lifts from when you arrived. on the second floor, there is a gentleman that scans your quarantine order and you can go. staff are all very nice and professional.room reviewthe room assigned to me was a so-called deluxe room, 29 sqmt. however, i doubt that room was really 29 sqmt: the hotel is built as a square, and my room was in one corner, so the two main walls were not parallel, which came out with a significant reduction in space. that, however, is the less of the issues. the room is old, and the carpet is over any reasonable level of hygiene: i founded nails and long hairs from previous guests. i believe the housekeeping disinfect the carpet with spray (it was unbelievably sticky, especially during the first days) between one guest and another but i doubt they clean with a vacuum cleaner. the bathroom was very smelly. the room is not well furnished with too many amenities: tissue boxes, two toilet paper rolls, few towels (3 for the body and 3 for hands, two sleepers, one hairdryer), and two shampoos and two bath gels. there is a small pack of detergent powder for laundry. they provide two coffee cups, two spoons, one water boiler, few instant coffees, english breakfast tea, and sugars. there is one small fridge but working well. there are 30 bottles of water, and if you want more, it cost 5$ each bottle. there is a large sony tv (that is not smart) with an hdmi port, and you need to remember to bring an hdmi cable with you. there is a good selection of international channels (from australia, us, hk, japan, france, gcc, mainland, uk, india, korea). internet is quite good and easy to connect. i had a queen bed with a 3 cm topper, a round glass table, a sofa. all around one of the walls, there is a long table where you can comfortably work. the windows are locked, small, and have a monotonous view of the pool. lighting is adequate, while ac is noisy and old. suggestions to managementi was aware the food in this hotel was not good, and i came ready for that. but what surprised me was the missing of basic hygiene in the room. if i understood – not justify – few long hairs can remain on the carpet, having long hairs on a fresh new towel, or nails on the floor is not acceptable. since this hotel is providing a service for the community that is intended to stop the diffusion of a disease, i wonder why we should remain confined in such an environment. as a takeover from this stay, i am not sure i will remember the stench coming from the bathroom or the carpets' hairs/nails.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,

Because before I joined to 14 day-quarantine I had read reviews and seen photos of other guests who criticize about the provided food. First of all I want to point out that I here only rate 'Average' it is ONLY according to the food!! The room and cleanliness I would like to rate 'Excellent'! The management had always promised in past postings to previous guests to improve the food. When I now came to hotel, I thought the food problem would be solved meanwhile. But it was not really. I received same food as I had seen before on this page. So after 3 days I myself had written a review, too. The hotel management quickly responded to my first review. I have spoken (on phone) twice directly to the director of operation food & beverage. The communication with Mr Chan was very pleasant and it is really a relief to know as a guest that the hotel takes review seriously. We discussed what's wrong, why I was so disappointed. For example the vegetable comes very bland, not cooked well. Frozen veggies. Normally in HK a no go. Or breakfast partly quite low standard. I honestly tell that I didn't expect it because such negative aspects of the food doesn't match the 5 star of this hotel. I booked standard room. I know guests of Deluxe room get food of higher quality. Anyway, I think we all are equal guests who pay for our rooms. For me 23 qm3 of room size absolutely okay and it is clean - very good!!  I yesterday order in addition a further set of water for drinking, I have no problem to pay for it. During communication I learned that the director who is responsible of the gastronomy is new in this hotel. So I assume all the not so good food selections are due to previous manager. In general I know it is globally not easy to run business especially for hotels/restaurants during pandemic time. Making financial loss, so to be more careful with handling the budgets. In my other review I already mentioned that in a place especially like HK it is very good and easier than other countries to obtain ingredients of high quality. For example fresh vegetables or fruits of moderate prices. I think a 5 star hotel has also a kitchen team of same category. The director of food after my first review offers and gives me in addition to meals fresh fruits in box and/or dessert. This is really a very nice gesture. I say again here Thank You. Surprisingly I receive a cake with 'Sorry' sign (see photos) and a letter handwritten from Mr Chan with apologize for inconvenience. Honestly, I am not greedy and I only wanted to let hotel know that in some parts in the food are really not okay. I really welcome these big gestures and I will not easily forget this. Thank You again! I know as well to improve and to change some ingredients in meals can not be made in one day. And the covid matter definitely will not end this year, not next year  (I know it from my docs, we work in laboratory, daily testing enough covid cases in Germany). Dear Regal hotel, you will still have lots guests in quarantine in future, as long as HK gov. forces this law. Therefore to give people who are long enough locked inside rooms a happiness in expression of nice meals (must even not be expensive)  -  it brightens everyone's face!

That said, the Regal Airport Hotel did a good job of making it as easy as possible.  We had a Deluxe Room (and would have taken a Suite if one had been available).  It was room enough for 2 people; with a small sofa, desk, king size bed and enough floor space for one person at a time to comfortably exercise.  The room was spotlessly clean when we arrived.  Service was excellent, whenever we requested more supplies, they arrived quickly and abundantly.  The standard food was acceptable (though not great).  But, the menu is fixed.  We brought some food with us and also ordered delivery.  The hotel also offers room service, but we did not try that.  On food delivery, the remoteness of the hotel limits the selection a bit, mostly to restaurants in Tung Chung.  The hotel quickly sent deliveries to our room as soon as they arrived.Internet was fast and stable.  TV channel choices are limited.  On thing we missed was the ability to stream from a tablet or phone to the TV, either wirelessly or by an HDMI cable.

Covid19 has made traveling a chore and if you are traveling it’s because you need to. One of the HK requirements of traveling abroad is that if you wish to return you need to show proof of a reservation in a quarantine hotel. I chose the Regal Airport Hotel as a second choice because of many of my first preferences were not available. My return coincided with multiple returning kids from the UK and popular hotels (believe it it or not) were full! However it’s the best decision I made. These were many reasons that worked for my son and I as travellers:1. It’s convenient ! After spending anywhere between 2-3 hours in the airport for immigration, tests, multiple checks and luggage you want to get quickly to a place you can rest in. We wheeled our luggage from the airport right to our room door (no Porter allowed to touch your luggage). We didn’t have to wait for shuttle buses and then being cramped in a bus with other passengers, stopping at multiple locations. 2. The rooms are bigger than a normal sized hotel room in HK! Unless you’re paying for a suite most rooms in HK average about 25 sq m or less. The quarantine room at the RA is 33 sq m. Space enough for double occupants. Space for drying wet things. Space to exercise in. 3. Extras that help cabin-fever!We had access to exercise e-programmes and even exercise equipment. You could rent yoga mats, cycle machines and treadmills etc. 4. It’s an International hotel . As with all airport hotels they have had international travellers of all ilk and creed. English is spoken and understood by the staff. All literature in the room is in several languages. Food is served three times daily at set hours serving rice based meals but if you ignore the rice, you get accompanying tasty English stews, Chinese cuisine, Indian curry and even Beef steak ! 5. Plentiful amenities.Bottles of water, coffee, tea, Expresso machine, double of shampoo/body wash/conditioner/toothbrushes/washing powder/ comb/ shavers/ shower caps/ soap , toilet rolls, tissue boxes, bed linens etc and for me , decent bathrobes and slippers ! Also Skoll beer and 7-up for those who need the extra energy boost! 6. Equipment. Wifi allowed 4 devices but at fantastic speed and didn’t fail. Fridge is good enough for small items. Seriously nice coffee from Expresso machine with Lavazza pods. TV with cable access so we watched the Olympics live. Quiet room (except for the odd thumping of an over exuberant guest above us exercising). I would suggest 2 additional items - small bottle of dishwashing liquid and access to the internet on TV. The view was good of the sea, buildings and even the odd aeroplane landing. Glad they kept up the plastic cutlery. I was able to cut my steak and oranges etc without the cutlery failing me! (Seriously, forget about those wood/paper alternatives!) Sadly one matter didn’t meet our expectation - the toilet stank of rotten eggs every time we flushed. Hope they can do something about it.

Staff not helpful at all. We experienced several occasions where one staff was notified on an issue and was not able to follow-up. I called one afternoon to get the next day's lunch changed from Set A to Set B as our original meal contains something we do not eat.

I recommend!,"What appealed to me about this venue is the convenience of being directly accessible after a long flight. Having researched the floor space of rooms in HK hotels I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was sufficient space to allow mobility around rooms at the RAH. Booking online was simple and efficient with prompt confirmation. However, because of difficulty with the airline and errors in the pre departure pcr testing paperwork, I had to plead with the hotel reservation team to change my dates no less than 3 times. The team (namely Polly Lai) dealt with my requests sympathetically without any sense of judgement. It was an extremely stressful time trying to synchronise all elements of qualification for entry to HK. RAH was by far the most helpful out of all the agencies (airline, travel agent, pcr company, etc) I dealt with.The stay itself was uneventful and despite my anticipation that being confined in a room without opening windows for fresh air might take a toll on my physical/mental health the days went past very quickly. This was largely due to the fact that I had booked a family size room with 2 double beds, a long desk to work at and a coffee table and armchair next to a large window from which I could observe the world outside. There was a partial sea and coastal view and an adjacent building site of a new shiny glass building, typical HK scenery. I also had great close up views of the few permitted aircrafts approaching the runway and surprisingly there was no noise or vibration. Also the stable room temperature suggested very sufficient insulation. Even with outside temperatures being 30 deg centigrade the room never rose beyond a comfortable 23 deg mostly without need to use the a/c.The decor is mixed with a few modern touches such as the new large flat screen TV but also some dated dark and scuffed doors, wall panelling and furniture. Fortunately the abundance of natural daylight coming through the window and the crisp white bed linen offset the darkness. There is a slight issue with general cleanliness, nothing terrible, just a few stains on wall/carpet/bathtub. The bed looked clean and inviting after the flight.

While the food quality was okay serving rice almost every day for lunch and dinner is not acceptable for an international airport hotel. The staff conducting the testing I found to be extremely rude (with exception of the team on 3rd test who were courteous). I also heard test team banging on neighbours door and shouting. This is unacceptable!. Staff answering phone generally courteous and helpful but often phone went unanswered.

When someone turned up 15 min later they explained they had to check someone else out. This is all well and good but why not phone the room and notify the guest there is a delay? Finally for an international hotel I found the TV entertainment in English language limiting. There was English language news and four channels of Nat Geographic and BBC. No English language film channels etc. If I compare with stay at Novotel Heathrow during 10 day quarantine in UK a huge difference. Excellent range of TV channels for many different nationalities. Also food was hugely varied for different nationalities with vegetarian options, and others (Indian, Japanese etc.) No rudeness or rapping on doors three times a day.

I have been a resident of Hong Kong for the past 26 years and enjoy Asian food but what is served up is , with few exceptions, bland, repetitive ,unimaginative and invariably bulked out with rice. It is more consistent with that of a detention centre than a hotel of the Regal’s stature. I also had the unfortunate experience of mild food poisoning following the day 8 evening meal which led to an uncomfortable night and following day. The menu has definitely been pared down to minimum cost presumably to direct people to the expensive room service option.Outside delivery choices are very limited and you really have to have family and friends who can make food deliveries to the hotel.Looking back through previous reviews reveals that  I am not alone in making negative comments about the catering quality. Unfortunately, the management feedback to all these comments says that they are noted and will be referred to the appropriate department for improvement.

The hotel is well kept in terms of cleanliness. Everything seems to be organized in terms of guest arrival and checkout is smooth. I stayed at their standard room which was more spacious than the other quarantine hotels with similar prices. Room includes a desk and swivel chair, convenient for doing some work on my laptop. Bed was soft and comfortable, and WIFI working great. 24 small bottles of water are given complimentary.With the food, it is what it is. If you pay for a suite, I believe you will get a few extra food items but don't expect to get the same quality food at a hotel buffet. It is more like cafeteria. For breakfast it changes everyday, however sometimes you'll get Chinese food items, which is understandable for others, but as a foreigner I'd prefer western breakfast food items every time. I don't mind having toast and boiled eggs everyday. Suggest giving an option just for the breakfast? For lunch and dinner, I don't mind Asian food items, I enjoy it. White rice is the main carbohydrate component almost all the time. Maybe 4 or 5 days I have had spaghetti. I understand it's cheap however not really much of a nutritional benefit. With protein, sometimes there's a lot of fat with the beef or short ribs. Chicken is alright. Some highlights were the Thai green curry, I thank the cook who made that recipe, really good. But otherwise, food quality is way far from any standard of a 4 or 5 star, even a 3 star. There is room service available and the hotel accepts deliveries at certain times. If you want to order food delivery from third party apps, as far as I know, only Pizzahut, KFC and McDonalds and maybe 2 other restaurants will be offered due to the location of the hotel. The hotel's room service is only available from noon to 10pm. The options are not a lot as you can't order from their other outlets. I have ordered a few times the chicken Caesar salad. It was fine however there seems to be a problem with the standard of the dish. One time the chicken was much smaller then what I had previously got. And another time the Caesar dressing was too bitter and almost no cheese on the salad. Different chef? Doesn't excuse the fact that a standard should be maintained. In conclusion, the food is really what brought my rating to a 3 than a 4, of course this is a quarantine review. I usually would only have breakfast at a hotel, with exception if they had a unique restaurant or bar.

All in all, it's not bad for that price, but I hesitate to recommend it to others. Pros:1. Location: it's walkable distance from the airport so that you don't need to wait for the government shuttle after having waited for almost 3 or 4 hours for your PCR test result.2. Room: Room size was one of the key reason for choosing this hotel. The standard room is 22 sq m, which is quite spacious compared with other downtown hotel rooms. I'm quarantining with my wife. There is enough counter space for two laptops, and enough floor space for a yoga mat, plus 4 big suitcases etc. There is a two-seater couch and a coffee table in the room. The carpet, though worn out, seems clean. Bedding linens are stained and frayed, but also clean. Our room on the third floor actually comes with a patio by the pool. But the door to the patio was locked (which I don't think is necessary, the pool is closed and I haven't seen more than 2 hotel staffers passing by my patio in the past 9 days. There are no neighbouring rooms next to mine, so it really doesn't make sense to lock us off the patio. Having some outdoor space would make it a 5-star experience for sure. I don't mind wearing a mask outside).3. Nice touches: there is some laundry detergent provided. Two of the hangers can be removed from the closet and be used for drying your laundry (though we brought a few hangers still). Each person is provided 1 bottle of water each day. Occasionally, the breakfast comes with boxed drinks like lemon tea and soymilk. There is a small orange or apple every few days.4. Responsive service: the service team is very efficient. My family sent us some food and it always arrived at my door within 15 minutes after my family left. The team was quick to send us additional instant coffee, bedding and towels too.5. Good wifi: strong signal, smooth streaming of media, good voice calls. Cons:1. Location: Please note that food delivery services do not cover this hotel. Your only choice (if you're sick of the boarding school style food) is to order room service from the hotel's kitchen, or to ask your friends and family to bring you food. Worse still, both my wife's and my cell phone services are so weak in this hotel that I almost couldn't complete a phone call without countless ""Huh?"" and ""Can you hear me?""2. Room: The room is very very dated: 90s wall paper that is stained, ripped, repasted; stained curtains; nicked and scratched furniture; cracked and messily grouted tiles and toilet cistern in the washroom. The washroom smells of mildew always. If you're just staying one night for connecting flight, you'd be better off just getting a bed from one of the hotel lounges.3. Food: The food is edible and the portion size is mostly adequate (except the scanty breakfast). But it is rarely enjoyable. I don't think it's from the hotel's kitchen as it looks pretty much like what the government quanrantine camp offers. For lunches and dinners, there must be enough rice to keep you full. But the backbone of all meals is either ground pork or extremely overcooked and dry chicken meat that is drenched in different sauces -- tomato, black pepper, black bean, soy, curry etc. The green curry chicken is the only meal that can be classified as ""good"" but my wife got a headache from its MSG.  The veggie -- white cabbage, napa cabbage, broccoli, frozen peas, frozen sweet corn -- is blanched in water and unseasoned. Trust me, you'd really need someone to bring you fruit, snacks, cup noodles and other hot food.

As of my first day, I realised that a man in a neighbouring room made it his daily occupation to emit high-pitched, screeching, psychosis-inducing whining noise in a faulty progression of several notes, on repeat, for 5 to 6 hours per day, every day. I called the hotel management every day, reported the noise, and asked to take measures to stop the noise. The hotel management first, suggested that I might be hallucinating; second, lied to me about ""taking measures"" where in fact they were not intending to take any measures and just fed me lies to wait for the man to complete his quarantine and leave. As a result, my mental health deteriorated quite significantly during the quarantine, in particular given the situation of extended confinement where I could not leave the room and all I could do was call the hotel management, who ultimately failed at their duty of care. I currently suffer from bouts of depression, anxiety, insomnia, sensitivity to noise, and possibly some effects of PTSD following the stay. The hotel exacerbated the injury by suggesting that I was hallucinating, when in fact the other confinees on the floor also suffered from that noise. At one point in the midsts of one of the psychotic high-pitched areas, I opened the door and yelled at the top of my lungs for the man to stop. He peaked out of his room and said that since he is a singer, he should not be expected not to sing in his confinement. He then proceeded to disregard our further complaints, and continued his maddening faulty progression of five notes on interminable loop. Dorsett Wanchai enabled him in inflicting the sound torture on us until the man completed his quarantine and left. The staff of that hotel is grossly incompetent as they were unwilling and unable to deal with the recalcitrant occupant to the detriment of the others, including myself. I strongly advise against staying in this hotel, in particular for an extended quarantine period, because you may end up in a desperate confinement subjected to the deviant behaviour that the hotel is unwilling and unable to resolve.

Of course,  I immediately called Reception, at first they explained that this is due to the Hotel rooms distribution. I kindly asked to speak to the Manager who, realizing the mistake he finally changed me to the room standards I paid for.Couple of points Management should look into.1- making guests extra pay for cutlery makes guests feel insulted, or at least provide a knife in the room and not just spoon & fork. 2- Mini bar fridge is hot so cannot refrigerate any items at all. 3- on a 12th floor not being able to open the windows (they are locked ) for fresh air makes any human feel claustrophobic, in fact the world health organization highly recommends ventilation against the covid-19 pandemic.  From what I read on the hotel rules, only people who reserve suits can have the chance to open its windows.4- I asked for a mini vacuum cleaner to clean my room but they also charge for that as well, meaning if you want to clean your own room you have to pay for it.

","Responded June 3, 2021","just ok value for money (quarantine package) considering i had booked a superior room it was extremely disappointing when i arrive at the hotel after 22 hours of travelling.when i arrived at my room i realized that they had given me a standard room which it costs 200hkd less per day than what i paid when i booked 800hkd per day (for a superior room), what it made me think they just tried to see if i was gonna accept it or not. of course,  i immediately called reception, at first they explained that this is due to the hotel rooms distribution. i kindly asked to speak to the manager who, realizing the mistake he finally changed me to the room standards i paid for.couple of points management should look into.1- making guests extra pay for cutlery makes guests feel insulted, or at least provide a knife in the room and not just spoon & fork. 2- mini bar fridge is hot so cannot refrigerate any items at all. 3- on a 12th floor not being able to open the windows (they are locked ) for fresh air makes any human feel claustrophobic, in fact the world health organization highly recommends ventilation against the covid-19 pandemic.  from what i read on the hotel rules, only people who reserve suits can have the chance to open its windows.4- i asked for a mini vacuum cleaner to clean my room but they also charge for that as well, meaning if you want to clean your own room you have to pay for it. belonging to restaurants/hotels hospitality world myself, i just thought of sharing some constructive feedback regarding my own experience. i would also like to personally thank zoe su (reception manager) for her attentive & hospitable service. she is without a doubt a great ambassador for the brand, as well as thanking room service for their quick deliveries every time something was requested.best regards,diego mateo sanchez.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

Here are some points during my 21 day stay...- The management is accommodating and very helpful, but sometimes better talk to a manager if you really need something resolved. I think this is a strong point of the hotel.- There is a semi official hotel whatsapp group created by the hotel, you can contact them via that or just quicker to ring really.- There is a whatsapp group for us quarantiners, friendly bunch.- There are two windows, one of them will open. Very few hotels can do this.- You can cancel booking outside two weeks before checkin. Don't think many hotels allow this.- Food can be ordered from outside, lots of options.- If you are used to eating hong kong cantonese food then lunch and dinner is mostly ok, maybe 60%? I know some people just cancelled all the food entirely. The Spaghetti Carbonara is famously unappetising, you will only encounter that twice in the 21 days.- Breakfast, a mix of cantonese and western, the western versions are proper confusion food, neither east or west, I mostly had my own cereal, I always thought the scrambled eggs aren't too bad though.- They provide a weekly small treat every friday, like local tarts and mochi.- They provide a welcome plant which I guess is quite nice.- The rooms are modern, comfortable and clean.- Beds a bit on the soft side but just about ok and comfy enough.- Aircon is strong and works well.- Wifi is fast, you can easily go on vpn and watch netflix in your own country, whatsapp video and skype calls are good.- Tv channels aren't bad, a good mix of cantonese/english/mandarin.- Dinner generally arrives around 7pm, but sometimes arrive late, especially over weekends, they have a time limit no later than 8pm.- The hotel food arrives generally luke warm, so some people rent a microwave from the hotel. I had a small electric heating pot and sort of reheated it, which made it much more palatable since you may want to eat it an hour later or something.- If you are on the lower floors, the traffic can be quite noisy, especially when the windows are open, I used ear plugs now and then.- I managed to move the bed over a little, providing some space to work out.- You need to have some way to dry clothes, like a hanging clothes carousel or something.- I chose a city racecourse facing room, the back rooms don't have views, the windows are smoked and don't open. I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS FOR THESE ROOMS!- Sound proofing in the rooms are pretty good.- The lighting in the room is on the dark side, you may need to bring a strong LED lamp or something.- Since I had many devices I brought a socket bank with me.- The rooms can get quite dusty, you may want to source a small vacuum cleaner or rent from the hotel.- The hotel has a rewards system with points you can redeem for stuff, just read up about it after you've checkedin, you may find it handy, I didn't understand it to be honest.- 21 days in the room on my own is long, you really need to have a schedule, I mixed the days doing a long workout using exercise bands and online workouts, some people rent bikes rowing machines ...etc. Plus work and reading, watching movies and TV.Overall a good stay you just need to be aware of some of the negatives.",1,"dear kai, thank you for your valuable comments. we are really happy to know that you had a lovely stay with us even during quarantine. we understand how difficult it is to undergo quarantine, which is why we are looking into the small details to provide our guests responsive services and a truly hassle-free experience. we’re also glad that you like the little surprises like the colourful flower pots, #tgif friday treats that we sent up to guests from time to time, hoping to cheer them up even during quarantine. as for the meals arrangement, we appreciate your time in sharing with us your valuable feedback. we understand that guests might have different preference when it comes to dining habit, and this is why we have included a wide range of cuisines such as western, asian, hk-style, chinese, japanese etc. and even vegetarian menus to cater to different guests’ needs. that said, your feedback about the food taste and the delivery time is well taken for our continuous improvement. regarding the room condition, we appreciate your understanding that cleaning service is not available during the quarantine period due to safety reason. that said, we do offer rental of vacuum cleaner if needed. lastly, we offer up to usd 281 free cash credits for guests who sign-up as our loyalty program, dorsett – your rewards, so that they can use the cash credits on in-room foodpanda menu as well as dorsett mart (the 24/7 online shopping platform where guests can purchase daily necessity and rent for fitness equipment and other entertainment gadgets) during their stay. kai, thank you again for your lovely comments. please stay safe and we hope to welcome you back for a truly leisure stay in the near future. thank you.

I booked a Premier Room with Racecourse View, and a window that opens, and in that respect I got exactly what I asked and paid for. The room is smaller than I expected, thanks to creative website photography - but caveat emptor on that one. However at HKD 1,400 a night it is fair value compared to the ‘big names’ and many of my fellow travellers have suffered from ambiguous booking procedures, waiting lists, last minute cancellations and price hikes - but none of that here.The hygiene standards are impeccable as you would expect for a hotel that is positioned as a quarantine only facility, and you can call for extra water, towels ice etc. They also permit outside supermarket and takeaway deliveries which is a real bonus because - and here comes the missing stars info - the food provided by the hotel for quarantine quests is appallingly bad.And by appallingly bad I don’t just mean by Western or ‘rich person’ standards. I mean by any standard. My Chinese work colleague who is also staying here at the same time as me described her food as ‘inedible’. Cold pasta with sauce, fried lumps of mystery meat, and tetra pack juice is not food as I know it. Nor is ‘Omni Pork’ - a laboratory created version of of actual meat, and where meat is served it all fat, skin and bone. Super high carb and sugar and minimal protein. No mattter where you are from in the world, people do not eat manufactured cheese sandwiches for breakfast...So yes, the hotel is guilty of profiteering from their captive quarantine guests which leaves me with a very bad taste in my mouth (excuse the pun), and that is shameful and unforgivable. No doubt I will hear all about their commitment to providing basic nutrition as per Government guidelines  blah blah - just as Boris Johnson did when he was lambasted for the poor quality of food packages sent to the elderly in the UK.

I spent my 2 weeks of quarantine at Dorsett Wan Chai. It was a wonderful experience from the time of check-in till check-out 14 days later. I don't think I would have quarantined anywhere else :)Excellent staff and service. They have changed the hospitality business toward catering to quarantine guests, simply phenomenal. I have not had a single issue for the entirety of my stay. The stand-out elements of my stay were: Wi-Fi, occasional welfare call from the front desk, replenishment of amenities (water bottle etc) without even asking, prompt delivery of Breakfast, earlier than promised deliveries of other meals, excellent laundry and an extremely comfortable bed. The room is as advertised online and I didn't feel claustrophobic at any time.

According to travel entrance restriction, visitors must stay quarantine for 14 days before they are free to move around. Hence, finding a hotel to stay during this crisis, has a lot to consider. Basically, you cannot step outside your room door for 14 days. Finding a hotel with window and hopefully with a scenic view is important. Location is better to be more central, as you could have more options to place takeaway orders. The moving space is only within your room; so, if budget allows, book a suite room. Hygiene maintenance of up keeping is crucial to consider during covid pandemic. It has taken us 13 hours from flight landing to clearance of testing and checked-in the hotel. Thus, room size, cost, hygiene, food order availability, service and being flexible to your check in time are all need to take into calculation. Most importantly is, whether they accept new visitor stay. (Deco and hardware of hotel is personal choice)We landed Hong Kong airport approximate at 13:15 and reached hotel 02:45 next morning. We were greeted by Ms Jophy Yau at the Front Desk, who assist us to complete the check in, is speedy, attentive and supportive. Impressively, the night manager Vincent, proactively lead us to our room with the porter and explain all the in-room facilities and breakfast arrangement.There was a day we have a minor issue with the washing basin, after reported to Zoe at front desk, the day time manager Mr Law brought two maintenance engineers to get it resolved imminently (we can’t leave our room and they shouldn’t take risk to enter either).Since, the price vs value rating, is very competitive under current market atmosphere (lots of bargain), we haven’t made much of other hotel bookings for the remaining trip prior flight. But we were so impressed with their attentiveness (and breakfast delivered), we decided to extend our stay with them immediately (after our initial 14 days).We called the reception and it was Ms Jophy Yau again. Hotel or restaurant is a hospitality trade, but most affiliate nowadays has forgotten about this. Having been staying in hotels like Four Season, Waldorf Astoria, Ritz Carlton to Boutique style hotel, what will make me write this review? Surely, there is something either too good or too bad to write about. After making this booking onwards, we feel so relaxed with almost all issue.

We choose the ""deluxe room"" which included breakfast boxes every morning and a window that would open for fresh air.The check-in process was quite smooth and the staff quite friendly. The reception area is airy and gives an impression of the hotel being a high-standard hotel. The deluxe room was quite good, but maybe not as spacious as I would have expected (but hotel rooms in Hong Kong are rumoured to be on the smaller size). The standard of the room was good, even though there were needs for a bit of fix ups here and there on a closer inspection (wallpaper that started to loosen, scratches that could be removed etc). The service during the 14 days was excellent. The staff was responsive, helpful and friendly throughout our stay. There was almost nothing that could not be arranged as long as its reasonable. Except for the manager talking ""over my head"" in an attempt to make me end the call, we had 0 unsatisfied moments regarding this, and this is a important part when you are stuck in the hotel room for 14 days. Food delivery can be made from outside (Uber, Foodpanda), but the hotel also offers food in co-operation with Foodpanda (more expensive than just using the app yourself).So what were the big let downs? The whole quarantine floor overlooks the highway, and even tho I asked for a quiet room as possible I don't think we could have gotten a more noisy one. It was situation exactly in the corner overlooking the highway on floor 6, which meant constant noise from traffic. When closing the window some of it was closed out but definitely still noticeable when going to bed/in the morning. If we weren't in quarantine we would never have accepted a room like that. In addition to the noisy room the breakfast boxes we were served the first morning were chicken nuggets, corn and sausage. This was considered to be the ""western breakfast"". We demanded that this be changed and the service was very responsive to our needs, which was another sign of their great service. When we were out of quarantine we got to experience the breakfast buffet, which was uninspirational and totally average. It had a poor selection of food and the dining room did not at all reflect the standard of the rest of the hotel. It felt like we entered a whole other hotel entirely.The location is good (if you get high enough to not hear the highway noise).",1,"dear edvinb,thank you for your comments. we are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and appreciated our services. we will definitely pass your compliments to our team to keep them motivated. meanwhile, your comments on the breakfast buffet options have been reflected to the restaurant manager for continuous improvement. we’ve also noted your comments regarding the sound insulations issues, your kind understanding is much appreciated. on your next visit, you are recommended to try out our other room types located on higher floors with size up to 48 sq. m for more comfortable stay. in the future we will continue providing the best stay experience to all guests in dorsett wanchai, hong kong. we look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel soon.","Responded July 26, 2020","quarantine stay with exceptional service but not exceptional overall me and my husband stayed at this hotel for a 14-day quarantine. we choose the ""deluxe room"" which included breakfast boxes every morning and a window that would open for fresh air.the check-in process was quite smooth and the staff quite friendly. the reception area is airy and gives an impression of the hotel being a high-standard hotel. the deluxe room was quite good, but maybe not as spacious as i would have expected (but hotel rooms in hong kong are rumoured to be on the smaller size). the standard of the room was good, even though there were needs for a bit of fix ups here and there on a closer inspection (wallpaper that started to loosen, scratches that could be removed etc). the service during the 14 days was excellent. the staff was responsive, helpful and friendly throughout our stay. there was almost nothing that could not be arranged as long as its reasonable. except for the manager talking ""over my head"" in an attempt to make me end the call, we had 0 unsatisfied moments regarding this, and this is a important part when you are stuck in the hotel room for 14 days. food delivery can be made from outside (uber, foodpanda), but the hotel also offers food in co-operation with foodpanda (more expensive than just using the app yourself).so what were the big let downs? the whole quarantine floor overlooks the highway, and even tho i asked for a quiet room as possible i don't think we could have gotten a more noisy one. it was situation exactly in the corner overlooking the highway on floor 6, which meant constant noise from traffic. when closing the window some of it was closed out but definitely still noticeable when going to bed/in the morning. if we weren't in quarantine we would never have accepted a room like that. in addition to the noisy room the breakfast boxes we were served the first morning were chicken nuggets, corn and sausage. this was considered to be the ""western breakfast"". we demanded that this be changed and the service was very responsive to our needs, which was another sign of their great service. when we were out of quarantine we got to experience the breakfast buffet, which was uninspirational and totally average. it had a poor selection of food and the dining room did not at all reflect the standard of the rest of the hotel. it felt like we entered a whole other hotel entirely.the location is good (if you get high enough to not hear the highway noise).",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,,

The staff was helpful, polite, and friendly.  The breakfast included in the price was acceptable but not great.The hotel should be explicit in its conditions for quarantine. We were asked to sign a form at the reception that in the event of one of us being infected with coronnavirus, we would be charged 7,500HKD for deep cleaning. This was not mentioned on its website nor was I told when the booking was made. On its website, it mentioned that temperature would be taken twice a day outside our room, which contributed my decision to book with the hotel. It didn't. Instead, we were charged 100HKD for a thermometer. I didn't pay for it and thought that it was a bit mean.Our room had two large double beds. Yet we used only one bed. The manager suggested that we could use the other bed for our clothes. This was ridiculous, given the fact that we were isolated in a room for 14 days and needed space to move about. In the end, they were able to find us a room with one double bed, despite initially saying they didn't have a room with only one bed.

Arrival: Checkin was very smooth, and the receptionist was very kind and courteous. When I arrived in the room, it felt very thoroughly cleaned and all previous arrangements and requests were also taken care of (like the microwave, walking pad and single bed instead of double). Amenities/room size: My room was Room Comfort and it was spacious enough for me to do some cardio workouts and pilates even with the walking pad. The room came with 24 bottles of water, which you could easily ask for refills and a tray of fruits as a welcome gift. Also came with metal cutlery and dishwashing liquid/sponge to be more environmentally friendly. Extra linen were provided (bedsheets, duvet and towels) but could easily ask for more if needed. I really liked the air purifier, the room feels a lot less stuffy and good to have a bit of background noise. My room was on the 17th floor and I had a good view! Food: For the most of my stay there were not repeating meals. I like the variety of it, from Western food to Asian, including Chinese, Japanese, Thai, so you don't get bored of the meals. Most of the time it also comes in a ""bento"" style so you have some meat (if you chose the non-vegetarian menu like me), rice, vegetables, soup, etc. I would have preferred if there was more vegetables and less rice, and sometimes it is a bit salty and portions could be small, but overall the taste is good/okay. Food also came warm so there was no need to heat it up in the microwave if you eat right away.***Service: I think the customer service in Dorsett Mong kok was really top-notch and I think made my stay very pleasant.

Dorsett Mongkok, despite their room being smaller in size, clearly stands out in terms of their superb guest service and my stay has been a pleasant surprise and I would certainly recommend it.First and foremost, the room itself is not big for two persons (probably big enough for one given we are in Hong Kong) but it's clean and quiet with sunshine coming in every morning through the big glass wall and window, brightening our mood. Three meals are provided and they are varied from traditional Hong Kong style breakfast to super nice Thai style Hainan Chicken Rice for lunch and Japanese style or Taiwan style Bento for dinner. Fruits are also provided at dinner almost everyday. The fridge is well stocked with cans of soft drinks which can be refilled for free! Of course they also provide bottles of distilled water but nothing beats Coke or Fanta with a meal, right :) The most remarkable feature is the warm calls from the guest service managers Sam and Eric. Sam, in particular, called us multiple times throughout our stay to make sure we are doing okay and whether we need any more supplies. They don't have to do this but these calls provide a constant source of support and show that they actually care and in turn made our hearts warm, which are very important if one had to go through a long quarantine, completely isolated from the outside world. They really made us feel welcome and all the staff that I called (housekeeping and reception) have been really helpful and supportive.Another plus is the Dorsett Rewards which can be used to redeem deliveries from FoodPanda or some snacks or other essentials from their online supermarket.A secret tip for future travellers is to bring with you a number of those suction hooks (like those that can be used on windscreen or glass mirrors) as they can provide a lot more areas where you can hang clothes or towels or laundry (which you have to wash yourself).So, in short, highly recommend, well done staff of Dorsett Mongkok and in particular, thank you Sam!!",1,"dear helen, thank you for taking the time to share your long stay experience with us. we are delighted to know that you’ve enjoyed your quarantine stay at our hotel. we’ve delivered your compliments to sam and eric personally. your kind words are such a great motivation to us! we know spending so many days in quarantine is not easy, so our team strives to do our best offering prompt and thoughtful services whenever you need. our guest services team would also make courtesy calls to check on our guests regularly to ensure they are all enjoying their stay. on the other hand, we hope that the nice view from the room, the high-speed wi-fi, the provision of a wide range of in-room amenities tailored specifically for quarantine guest’s needs as well as our prompt and thoughtful services would have made up for the room size. on your next visit on some mask-free day, we wish you would consider our suite premier / family quad measuring up to 42sq.m. for a more spacious and comfortable stay. when covid fades away, you are welcome to visit us again for another pleasant stay. thank you again for choosing dorsett mongkok as your quarantine hotel in hong kong.","Responded November 18, 2021","21 day quarantine made bearable by superb service this is my second 21 day quarantine in a span of 6 months :( and i stayed at different hotels. dorsett mongkok, despite their room being smaller in size, clearly stands out in terms of their superb guest service and my stay has been a pleasant surprise and i would certainly recommend it.first and foremost, the room itself is not big for two persons (probably big enough for one given we are in hong kong) but it's clean and quiet with sunshine coming in every morning through the big glass wall and window, brightening our mood. three meals are provided and they are varied from traditional hong kong style breakfast to super nice thai style hainan chicken rice for lunch and japanese style or taiwan style bento for dinner. fruits are also provided at dinner almost everyday. the fridge is well stocked with cans of soft drinks which can be refilled for free! of course they also provide bottles of distilled water but nothing beats coke or fanta with a meal, right :) the most remarkable feature is the warm calls from the guest service managers sam and eric. sam, in particular, called us multiple times throughout our stay to make sure we are doing okay and whether we need any more supplies. they don't have to do this but these calls provide a constant source of support and show that they actually care and in turn made our hearts warm, which are very important if one had to go through a long quarantine, completely isolated from the outside world. they really made us feel welcome and all the staff that i called (housekeeping and reception) have been really helpful and supportive.another plus is the dorsett rewards which can be used to redeem deliveries from foodpanda or some snacks or other essentials from their online supermarket.a secret tip for future travellers is to bring with you a number of those suction hooks (like those that can be used on windscreen or glass mirrors) as they can provide a lot more areas where you can hang clothes or towels or laundry (which you have to wash yourself).so, in short, highly recommend, well done staff of dorsett mongkok and in particular, thank you sam!!",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,,

My very good friend had reserved a room at Dorsett Mongkok for the quarantine package and suggested that I stay at the same hotel and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have to say I had such a wonderful experience staying at Dorsett Mongkok Hotel. The check in process was quick and smooth and filled with Cecilia's and Stephane's welcoming positive energy. I could feel their smiles through their tone of voice and their eyes. It was refreshing after a long flight and a long testing/waiting procedure at the airport. The hotel room size of my single occupancy room is on the small size compared to most boutique-style hotels. However, they had pre-arranged for my special request for my room before I checked-in. And the room has everything I needed and a small area big enough for my workout routine. Dorsett Mongkok provided a surprisingly tasty vegetarian menu for the quarantine stay package. I have tried both their regular menu and vegetarian menu; I have to say I enjoyed the vegetarian options very much. And there are so many nice local restaurants to choose from on the food Panda app. I mainly ordered milk, fruits, snacks and distilled water because the ""mineralized"" bottled water provided by the hotel was not my preferred kind of water. My bed was harder than I preferred but it varies by personal preference. The housekeeping department managed to help me rectify the situation, thank you! The hotel staff really showed their ""above and beyond"" service standard in a heart-warming style. I think the staff is really the winning element of this hotel. They tried their best to accommodate all of my needs and requests. Every time I talked to them on the phone, they always offered options and suggestions to me to fulfill my requests. The managers Augustine, Eric and a couple of other front desk staff members initiated phones calls to me just to make sure I was doing well during my stay and liked to find out if there was anything extra they could do to make my stay more comfortable. I felt that they genuinely cared about their hotel guests. Big thanks to Augustine, Eric, Sam, Stephane, Cecilia, Christy and many more amazing staff members for looking after me so well during my stay.

However, if you plan to stay in this hotel, please be prepared to order food delivery at least 1/3 or 1/2 of the time.  One or two of their quarantine meal providers were lousy.

The two weeks went by quickly largely due to the amazing customer service by Sam and his team. Here are a few highlights of my stay:1) Email communication has been very pleasant. They reply promptly and are always happy to assist in any way possible.2) There was a flight ban on my specific airline and flight number and the customer service team were the ones to notify me of this news! If they didn’t email me I may have found out too late and would have been scrambling to make new arrangements. So grateful. 3) I originally booked the superior room as that was the only one available, however, I emailed to ask if they had any larger rooms and they were able to offer me the family quad room and put it on hold for me while I made my decision. 4) The family quad room was extremely comfortable, a great size and had plenty of breakout spaces. I was able to ask them to remove one of the twin beds for more space. The bathtub was superb, I will miss it! 5) After my day 3 covid test came back negative, I was able to fill out a waiver form and open my windows. Having fresh air was such a life saver.6) Anything I requested the customer service team was able to provide: a dehumidifier, a wine opener etc. 7) Any outside food orders were delivered to the room so quickly! Most of the time within 10- 15 minutes of it arriving to the hotel. 8) I really appreciated Sam and his team calling to check on my well being and asking if I needed anything every few days. 9) The Dorsett mart vouchers were a nice treat! You can use them to buy food, or groceries etc. I was able to use the points for a discount on my treadmill rental. I also bought some CBD oil from the Dorsett mart which helped with my anxiety. 10) I appreciate the hotels sustainability practices. We were gifted with a metal utensil set to use in lieu of plastic forks and knives. They also provided a plate and bowl. Food containers can also be washed and recycled.Only downside for me was the food. You weren’t able to choose the between meals, just had to eat what was offered that day. Most meals were ok but there were a few that really were not appetizing to look at or eat. Also, the amount of vegetables provided each meal was too little. For example two slices of zucchini or two stems of bok choi. Luckily there were many food delivery options available in Mong Kok to supplement. Overall I had an amazing stay at Dorsett Mong Kok. I can’t rave enough about the amazing customer service. Every single person I dealt with was very pleasant and this alone made the entire experience that much more positive!

Very friendly, assured me of the process of testing and updated me on any requests I made, sorted out my Dorsett Mart points and regularly conducted welfare checks every 3 - 4 days to ensure I was OK, how I found my meals and if I needed anything replenished. Also supported me in making a request to Department of Health so I can open my window. I requested this after 10 days to ensure I‘ve already had a few negative tests beforehand. Such a game changer, when the days were really sunny in the morning to have a nice breeze coming through. <3 Always closed the window when the door needs to be opened, either for testing or collecting anything.= Dorsett MK staff - knowledgeable, professional, friendly and responsive.—- able to accommodate and amend my hotel booking after my original flight was cancelled. Responding to any queries very quickly before I arrived, and resent my hotel confirmation before I flew out. Shoutout to Reservations team Debby Chan, Christy Wong and Anna Yau—- always called beforehand when DoH came round to do their testing (this does not happen at all hotels). Also called to confirm if you ordered via their Dorsett Foodpanda menu.—- All food deliveries come to me around 10 minutes after arriving at the desk. You can request for 3 deliveries per day (food or otherwise) before DMK charge.—- Front desk when I checked in (sorry I didn’t catch her name, I arrived morning of 15th). The lady at the front desk went through all the information about my stay, if I needed anything the numbers to call and about the dates of when my next 6 tests will be as well as the specimen collection for my first test.—- Eddy Lo for the complimentary soft drinks :D= WhatsApp - managers can be contacted through WhatsApp and they’re always helpful and responsive.

All of it was very helpful, I prefer not to be “surprised” about anything during my 21 days.= Replenishable water - Also one of the reasons I chose Dorsett. Apart from the usual items like tea bags and towels and linen. This is not the case for all hotels so it’s a preference if you’re ok with tap water. Personally I’d rather stick to the bottled water, you get a box of 24x750ml when you arrive and then you need to call housekeeping for more. I managed to get through double this amount during my 21 days.= Comfortable bed, I got a twin room so I just took the extra blanket from the next bed= Good pressure for shower and tap= Complimentary cutlery for you to take with you after your quarantine, plate and bowl if you’d like to plate anything up - I recommend to bring a knife unless you’re happy to chew through a whole pork chop which is also fine. Also a mug if you prefer a larger sized cuppa.= Food menu - Good variety of Asian cuisines with the odd meal and day of western food. The portions were more than enough for me, although very carb heavy, I guess the idea is you don’t go hungry. It could do with a few more vegetables, like the chopped meat and rice meal came with 2 pieces of greens…I guess greens are expensive. It’s a personal preference but…I found the Asian meals more tasty. Some hotels allow you a choice menu, but I’m satisfied with what DMK has to offer so I wouldn’t need options.= HDMI cables can be borrowed - I had a USB C to USB connector but it wasn’t enough and silly of me to forgot to bring my own. I wouldn’t advise it for work as the tv is directly above you, but for films etcNegatives= Washing detergent - very weak and watered down, I had to go through two bottles of 200ml?, I read this in the other reviews so I brought my own small bottle of 30ml fairy liquid that lasted for 1+ week. You can ask for more but i just don’t find it cleans well enough. Especially if I wanted to recycle the food trays which will be kept in your room for the next 21 days…Other then that I don’t have many negatives, which was why I would be happy to come back to DMK and recommend it to others as a solid stay 21 day stay.Recommended to bring for your Q stay if you’re also working during your quarantine:~ Extension lead /HDMI cable (these are available to be borrowed from DMK) ~ Wireless keyboard (maximum size TKL) and mouse.

Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong,d1235711,r816843449,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1235711-r816843449-Dorsett_Mongkok_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong.html,"Reviewed October 31, 2021 ",2021,CBDB1D12A5D9705D04AF2ACC36C19DC5,5,"Amazing food, internet and service for a quarantine stay","I was looking for the cheapest option with decent internet and a desk that was available for my 14 day hotel quarantine in Hong Kong, and ended up at the Dorsett. Given the standard room wasn't available for my dates I paid a bit extra for a Comfort room, and was very glad I did. There were 2 single beds, but I stacked one up against the wall and then had plenty of space to exercise in. I was on the 7th floor, and had a great view from the large window of life in Hong Kong.Paying extra for the comfort room results in a better food menu, including amazing breakfasts every day. I chose the Vegetarian option, and it far far far exceeded my expectations - every day brought new surprises and I always looked forward to mealtimes so I could enjoy the delicious food brought to me.The hotel's service was legendary. Reception would frequently call or email me to check that everything was okay and to see if there was anything I needed. I could also call them at any time from the hotel room phone to ask for various amenities (eg water, towels, soap) which were rapidly brought up to my room. They were also happy to rapidly deliver items I purchased through apps to my room for free. The fridge in the room included free soft drinks.The hotel is very environmentally friendly, providing me with quality cutlery which I was encouraged to keep at the end of my stay. They also provided a bowl and plate, along with a tea towel, sponge and detergent so I could wash and dry my dishes after each meal. Guests were also encouraged to wash all plastic items and leave them in their rooms so they could be recycled at the end of the stay.The bed was a very firm, but I believe that is quite normal in Hong Kong. The pillows were of poor quality - if this matters to you you should consider bringing your own. The internet was very good - I could consistently get 100 Mb/s. The desk is long but is quite narrow, but is good enough for work and meals. However the chair is a simple stool with wheels and no backrest. It aligns with the pictures so I knew what I was getting myself into given I planned to do some serious work while in quarantine, but it still lead to a lot of back pain.

From the beginning of planning my trip until the check-in moment, the whole process was highly unpredictable due to the uncertainties caused by the Pandemic. One move (such as unilateral flight cancellation by the airliner) could render the whole trip impossible, which would have been the case without the help of Dorsett's well-trained and highly-responsive team! Dorsett is highly recommended for several reasons. Dorsett has a flexible schedule or the willingness to be flexible to cater to the needs of its clients.  My flight was cancelled once, and if no change is allowed by Dorsett, I would have to book another designated hotel which happened to have a room available, the chances of which were dim! I wrote to Dorsett, and they adjusted my booking - a simple move in the usual time saved my entire trip.  Dorsett has a highly responsive team.  Each and every of my emails were replied to within less than 10 hours, and the replies were both in details and to the point. This helped make me less anxious and my accomodation plan predictable. Dorsett  has not a greedy mind. Unlike many of its competitors in Hong Kong, which required payment upon booking, prohibiting refund in any circumstances  (even if you are denied entry into Hong Kong for any reason), Dorsett does not require payment while booking and allows FULL refund under certain circumstances (including sufficient prior notice, flight cancellation and denied entry for any reason, be it Covid-19 related or not).  This is extremely considerate. It is not easy to book a hotel from a basket of designated quarantine hotels at this time, and you will be surely denied entry into Hong Kong without a qualified hotel booking confirmation - vicious chain effect/circle here - you can't control airliners, you can't control hotel booking (if refund or any change of your schedule not allowed), and you can't predict what government policies will be next day.Dorsett has a ready to serve attitude. They have a built-in store where you can purchase or rent from toothpaste to a treadmill (as long as your room space allows) and it's working 24*7. They allow delivery by shoppers and your friends to the reception of almost everything (as long as you use your good sense and judgement; please do not blame anything if your request for the delivery of your pet is turned down). Dorsett has a well-trained and friendly team. They will walk you through all the requirements set by the governement and their hotel policies patiently and are happy to assit. The only 'weak' side might be the room size, the living area of which is about 9 square metres, which is not great but big enough for one person not too big (i'm 170cm and feels acceptable - thanks to the almost 3-4 metre room height). That said, the room is equipped with everything you need (a freezer stuffed with free soda water included) and all facilities are in good working order.  In addition, you have unlimited access to free Wifi and bottled water (a full box of 24 750ml bottled water is deposited, and you may ask for more, free). The hotel is located in the downtown of Hong Kong, and the price is not cheap, i.e., HKD 600-1000 (by the room space only)  but is of high value (if compared with other designated hotels, which may cost your over HKD50,000 for a 14-day stay). Anyway, it is Hong Kong. If you are planning a trip to Hong Kong while the restrictions are still effective, you may need to take one of Dorsett hotels into full account.

I will give priority to Dorsett when I need to book a hotel next time anyway!",1,"dear valued guest, thank you for taking the time to share your long stay experience with us. we are delighted to hear that you’ve enjoyed your quarantine stay with us. we do understand how difficult it is to undergo such a long quarantine, not to mentioned about the forced plan changes that happens from time to time before the stay. that’s why our teams are all happy to go above and beyond to ensure our guests’ needs and questions are accommodated with flexibility and answered promptly prior and during their stay. on the other hand, we hope that the nice view from the room, the high-speed wi-fi, the provision of a wide range of in-room amenities tailored specifically for quarantine guest’s needs as well as our prompt and thoughtful services would have made up for the room size. on your next visit on some mask-free day, we wish you would consider our suite premier / family quad measuring up to 42sq.m. for a more spacious and comfortable stay. when covid fades away, you are welcome to visit us again for another pleasant stay. thank you again for choosing dorsett mongkok as your quarantine hotel in hong kong.","Responded October 21, 2021","nice hotel, highly responsive staff i was staying for quarantine purposes. from the beginning of planning my trip until the check-in moment, the whole process was highly unpredictable due to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic. one move (such as unilateral flight cancellation by the airliner) could render the whole trip impossible, which would have been the case without the help of dorsett's well-trained and highly-responsive team! dorsett is highly recommended for several reasons. dorsett has a flexible schedule or the willingness to be flexible to cater to the needs of its clients.  my flight was cancelled once, and if no change is allowed by dorsett, i would have to book another designated hotel which happened to have a room available, the chances of which were dim! i wrote to dorsett, and they adjusted my booking - a simple move in the usual time saved my entire trip.  dorsett has a highly responsive team.  each and every of my emails were replied to within less than 10 hours, and the replies were both in details and to the point. this helped make me less anxious and my accomodation plan predictable. dorsett  has not a greedy mind. unlike many of its competitors in hong kong, which required payment upon booking, prohibiting refund in any circumstances  (even if you are denied entry into hong kong for any reason), dorsett does not require payment while booking and allows full refund under certain circumstances (including sufficient prior notice, flight cancellation and denied entry for any reason, be it covid-19 related or not).  this is extremely considerate. it is not easy to book a hotel from a basket of designated quarantine hotels at this time, and you will be surely denied entry into hong kong without a qualified hotel booking confirmation - vicious chain effect/circle here - you can't control airliners, you can't control hotel booking (if refund or any change of your schedule not allowed), and you can't predict what government policies will be next day.dorsett has a ready to serve attitude. they have a built-in store where you can purchase or rent from toothpaste to a treadmill (as long as your room space allows) and it's working 24*7. they allow delivery by shoppers and your friends to the reception of almost everything (as long as you use your good sense and judgement; please do not blame anything if your request for the delivery of your pet is turned down). dorsett has a well-trained and friendly team. they will walk you through all the requirements set by the governement and their hotel policies patiently and are happy to assit. the only 'weak' side might be the room size, the living area of which is about 9 square metres, which is not great but big enough for one person not too big (i'm 170cm and feels acceptable - thanks to the almost 3-4 metre room height). that said, the room is equipped with everything you need (a freezer stuffed with free soda water included) and all facilities are in good working order.  in addition, you have unlimited access to free wifi and bottled water (a full box of 24 750ml bottled water is deposited, and you may ask for more, free). the hotel is located in the downtown of hong kong, and the price is not cheap, i.e., hkd 600-1000 (by the room space only)  but is of high value (if compared with other designated hotels, which may cost your over hkd50,000 for a 14-day stay). anyway, it is hong kong. if you are planning a trip to hong kong while the restrictions are still effective, you may need to take one of dorsett hotels into full account. you may also check youtube to see other people's experience about dorsett. i will give priority to dorsett when i need to book a hotel next time anyway!",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,,

Could not have enough great things to say about the service at the hotel. - Room. The room was on the small side, barely fitting a queen sized bed, but it was well laid out and window ledge provided a great 2nd seating area. Originally I had wanted to book a twin room and have 1 of the beds removed to free up some floor space, but now looking back, it wasn't really an issue. I was still able to fit (albeit snugly) a yoga mat. And having the queen sized bed meant I had a larger space to lounge. Also, there appears to be 2 types of layouts for the superior rooms, the one with the corner desk, which I had, was probably more suited for those who plan on working.- Staff and service! While booking, sales agents were very responsive via email, and tried to accomodate my requests for type of room. I had to amend my travel dates once and they were able to accomodate. During my stay, Manager Gus and Sam called me multiple times to check in, see if I needed anything replenished, get feedback on a new caterer etc. They were even thoughtful enough to call to confirm a dietary request I had made, to see if the next day's meal would be suitable. I also requested some random items during my stay (extension cord, binder clips) and the staff sent them to me promptly. Manager phone's WhatsApp was very responsive.- Location. Though I didn't actually end up ordering out a lot, there was plenty in the area, and quite central for family to deliver things to me.- Amenities. Eco-conscious hotel provided reusable cutlery and dishes, and washed plastic food containers/water bottles would be recycled after guests leave. Hotel provided 24 bottles of water and unlimited tea bags, instant coffee and there was some pop in the fridge. Not sure if those were refillable. Was able to redeem hotel loyalty points (~350 HKD) for snacks and food delivery.- Delivery. All deliveries I had were brought up to my room within 10 minutes. And if I made any requests to housekeeping like extra towels, linens, were also brought up promptly.- Food. Honestly the food was pretty decent. A little carb heavy and light on the greens, but most things that were served were tasty. Among the 42 meals, only had a handful of repeats. All meals were delivered promptly, at reasonable hours, and hot.- Wifi. I brought a portable router with me and my room happened to have an ethernet port, so I didn't use the hotel WiFi. Those who did use the hotel WiFi, I heard there were some instances of people streaming on each other's Chromecast/smart TVs. So make sure to rename your devices to something unique.- Windows. AC was nice and strong. Was able to open window after signing some waivers and day 3 test results. The manager actually followed up with me a few times to see if I got my test results yet, as he knew I had requested to open the window.Not that I want to do another 14 day quarantine, but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate staying here again.

But when I could no longer wait out the pandemic, I booked Dorsett Mongkok mainly because of their reasonable cancellation & refund policies, in addition to being convenient for family members to deliver home cooked food in case there’s nothing I could eat. From the time I placed my booking, I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient and responsive the staff was at processing my booking and answering all my queries, especially the one on food, putting my mind at ease. I booked rather early for a superior room hoping for a more comfortable stay and requested for a certain floor plan with one single bed instead of a double for more space to exercise. So glad they listened and that had made a great difference to my comfort. So I told a friend about Dorsett & she also booked and checked in days before my flight. There was an urgent message I needed to reach out to her with and had to approach Dorsett by email at last resort, Dorsett impressed me by acting fast. Frustrating hours on the phone with CX in SG & HK did nothing to resolve the issue. From the day I checked in, duty manager Eddy presented me with the standard menu to start making meal adjustments & alternative arrangements. Gus worked with me to set up a new set of gluten free meals for the week. Sam made sure my meals were carefully looked after. Their guest services managers like Gus, Kevin & Sam were all terrific! All of them were so responsive, polite, helpful and friendly — I told them it already felt like home. Even though they work on shift rotation, there’s absolutely no lag in the response time when there were any queries or assistance needed.During my stay I craved for comfort foods such as chocolates, ice-cream, sundae & more … but knowing how they would do their best to pamper their guests, I hesitated to make my wishes known for becoming inconsiderate but still in our conversation, the hint was picked up and I got an ice-cream treat & even sundae. Thanks Kevin :) And of course every Friday, all guests enjoyed a special treat - mango mochi, absolutely divine! Although the quarantine duration for me was 14 days, the days passed quickly & it felt more like a beautiful staycation. So far each of the customer service managers had called periodically to find out how I was doing, and other staff called regularly to ask if I needed to replenish any amenities. I was very happy to receive a set of cutlery from the hotel to be used during the stay. We also had a bowl and a big plate so that we didn’t have to eat out of plastic containers if we chose not to! That’s a very nice touch … I wish we were given placemats and napkins too. I had brought along my own napkins, placemats, cutlery & tableware to remind me of home.

Yet, things have been great. The check-in process with Rachel at the front desk was smooth and efficient.

This process is centrally coordinated to ensure all arriving travellers are sent to their quarantine hotels- There are many quarantine hotels and they are distributed in different districts. Your shuttle bus trip will be shorter if your hotel is near the airport. It took us over an hour to arrive at DMH as there are other hotel stops and traffic is slow in the city core due to congestionCheck in - Since DMH is a quarantine hotel, you are not allowed to leave your room once checked in until you completed the mandated quarantine period (7, 14 or 21 days). After you checked in, nothing can come out from your room (except garbage and soiled linen). So if you and family are getting different rooms, make sure you pack your luggage accordingly as you cannot ask for things from another room - The process is fast and efficient while social distancing is maintained. The professional and courteous front desk staffs explained all the stay details but honesty I did not get too much of it after 25 hrs of travel. But there is nothing to worry as all the information is available in the roomThe room- My room has two twin beds and is clean but small- There is a Samsung SMART-TV (36”?) mounted on the wall with HDMI and USB input ports- There is no desk but a bench along the wall with two stools. It is challenging to work with your laptop as the bench height and the stools are not intended to be used as a work space/area- Because I have to quarantine for 14 days, I brought my external BT keyboard and mouse. I am happy that I did not bring my external monitor as there will be no space. I used the mouse only as there is no space for the keyboard. With a HDMI cable and BT keyboard and mouse, I think you can connect your laptop to the TV and work while in bed. It will be helpful if there is a lap pillow or breakfast tray for this setup - In room WIFI is free and password is not required. The speed is impressively fast. I did speedtest and got results of 80~90Mbps download and 70~78Mbps upload so there should be no issue with video streaming. I have my own mobile WIFI hotspot device but there is no need of it while staying in the room. I suggest you bring a HDMI cable or wireless display device if you will be working remotely. For leisure, make sure you have a tablet to keep your self entertained during the stay - The window cannot be opened and since we always have to maintain air circulation, we are not supposed to turn off the fan or the AC. I found the room cold even I set it to 25 degree C. I ended up asking for additional duvet- There is a ledge/bench by the window. I guess you can sit there while working but I never did as the surface is hard- There is a kettle, a small fridge with 8 free pops, bowl and plate, hair dryer, electric socket adapter and the usual coffee, tea, creamer, sugar, etc.- The hotel provide a set of cutlery as gift. This is good as this minimize plastic wasteThe bathroom- The bathroom is small but clean- The curtained shower stall is equipped with hand held and overhead rain shower head. I am from NA and we are used to water-saving shower heads. They are pathetic as water comes out in fine mist. You will love the water pressure and the abundant flow coming out from the faucets here at DMH- The shampoo, conditioner and body wash are from Elemis. toothbrush, tooth paste and other amenities are provided- Kitchen cleaning scrub/sponge, a bottle of washing detergent, wipe cloth and a cup are provided. The cup is for pouring water into the floor drain- Toilet bowl cleaner and brush are provided The bed- I am a picky sleeper but found the spring coil mattress surprisingly good. Our mattresses also have three layers of toppers/protector. I later found out not all the rooms have these mattress toppers- The duvet and pillow are good. The room is cold for me so I asked for additional pillow and duvetThe meals- The quarantine stay includes three meals a day and the menu repeats every 7 days. So if you are staying for 21 quarantine days, you will be eating the same set of meals three times- The staff will drop off the meals outside the room and knock the door. The schedule is 8-9:30am for breakfast, 11:30am-1:30pm for lunch, and 6-8pm for dinner. There were a few late deliveries and I have to called the front desk. - The meals are good but pretty high in carbs and don’t have a lot of vegetables. The dinner also include a fruit (apple, pear, orange or banana). I have regular diet so I did not ask for special meals. I am sure the hotel offers them but would suggest a healthier entries even for the regular meals. The meals are also not very hot.- No matter how good are the food you will get sick of them after a week. You can ask your friends to bring or order food from the outside and have them delivered to the hotel. The staff will bring the delivery and leave them outside your room. The hotel posted signs of cooperating food delivery providers like foodpanda and deliveroo. I am sure you can order from others and get them delivered to the hotelRoom services- As you are quarantined inside the room, the hotel cannot provide the usual services- When we checked in, the room already has a box of bottled water (24 x 750 ml), coffee, tea, creamer, and extra linen and towel- I called House Keeping to replenish anything needed. They are very responsive and leave the items outside my room within a short time- You are expected to put out the garbage in white bag and spoiled linen in black bag everyday before 2 pm for collection. Garbage bags are provided in the room- By staying at Dorsett, you are automatically enrolled to their reward program. The stay earns you reward points which can be redeemed as spending money to be used during the stay. You can use them to order food, buy necessities or rent items like microwave or exercising devices. The cost will be charged against the spending money and then the $1,000HKD incidental deposit Additional C-19 Tests- The authorities requires 4 more C-19 tests during my 14 days stay at the hotel. I think there will be more for 21 days stay- Day 3 is a deep throat saliva test. I provided the specimen sample and leave the bottle outside the room for collection- Day 5, 9 and 12 are swab tests. The authorities send testing team to the hotel and visit those who are scheduled for the test. The team with fully PPE conduct the test at the room door. This process take less than 5 mins each time - The front desk call ahead of time so I can prepare for the sample/testFeedbacks and Suggestions for DMHI am happy with my stay and feel that the hotel is doing their best to take care of their customers. I have a few suggestions:- if not already offered, provide lap pillow desk or in-bed breakfast tray  so people can work in bed; provide wireless display connector that wirelessly connect laptop or tablet to the TV. Alternatively provide a long HDMI cable; provide power bar- ensure meals are delivered on time and maintain food temperature- offer meals with less carbs and more vegetables - the washing basin faucet is very tight to turn on/off. I think the inner faucet cartridge or vault is calcified and should be inspected and changed- ensure the AC thermostat control can set the room temperature to comfortable setting - provide additional face masks, disinfecting wipes and liquid in pump form",1,"dear johnny, thank you for taking the time to share your long stay experience, we are glad to know that overall you enjoyed your quarantine stay with us. we understand guests might have different preferences when it comes to hotel quarantine, that’s why we offer various room types with room size up to 42 sq. m. for our guests’ selection according to their needs and budget. we hope that the nice view from the room, the high-speed wi-fi, the provision of a range of well-thought out amenities tailored specifically for quarantine guests’ needs as well as our prompt and thoughtful services would have made up for the room size. also, your suggestions on various in-room amenities and daily meals are well noted and reflected to the concerned departments for improvement. while our dedicated teams review the menu from time to time to include different kinds of cuisine, and even vegetarian menu; we will continue seek for necessary improvement on the food variety and food quality upon delivered, thank you for bringing these up to our attention.  to deliver to our guests a less hassle quarantine stay, we have launched the dorsett mart, an e-shoppping platform and foodpanda in-room dining menu, to bring groceries, fitness and entertainment equipment, and food of various cuisine from the outside to your door. we hope you made use of these services during your stay. once again, thank you for staying at dorsett mongkok, hong kong. we will continue to review and improve our services in every aspect per the guests’ feedback to provide you all with a more delightful and caring long stay.","Responded September 15, 2021","my 14 days of quarantine at the dorsett mongkok hotel (dmh) the hotel- dmh is located in the tai kok tsui district within kowloon city core and is one of the designated quarantine hotels by the hk government- after completing all the health and immigration checks with the authorities at the airport, you will register for the free hotel shuttle bus service. this process is centrally coordinated to ensure all arriving travellers are sent to their quarantine hotels- there are many quarantine hotels and they are distributed in different districts. your shuttle bus trip will be shorter if your hotel is near the airport. it took us over an hour to arrive at dmh as there are other hotel stops and traffic is slow in the city core due to congestioncheck in -

In short:1.  Meal arrived at random time.  One meal can be delivered late in the 2 hour range while the next meal arrives early in the 2 hour range.  I had  to eat 2 meals in between a few hours and go hungry for the next 12-15 hours. 2.  Meal always arrived cold or at most Luke warm.  The fruit included either orange, apple or banana is basically not eatable.  Banana is green, orange is super sour and apple is dirty with not washable stain and the hotel doesn’t provide any knife to peel the apple skin away.3.  Very unhealthy unbalance meal.  Normal meal hardly had any vegetables.  2 PCs of broccolis or one spoon of corn.4.  Hotel doesn’t provide disposable utensils.

Just got one of a few calls from the reception desk to check up on my health and needs, which made me feel cared for. Housekeeping is also very helpful and will bring you things when needed.  Being in quarantine for 2 weeks is no joke, especially when you are not allowed to step foot even outside the hotel room. So, it is important to keep oneself occupied with “activities”. The price includes 3 meals, a small fridge stocked with soda, which I don’t drink, supplies of linen, towels, water and other hotel usuals. The meals have been fine, especially if they stick with Chinese food. Western/fusion food is really not good. They give a credit of US$49, which you can get food and supplies from Food Panda and other electronics. It is helpful to get a SIM card because you would need a HK tel # for COVID tests. The form they give you at the airport can get you 2 free COVID tests post quarantine. The HK$48 3G was HK$80.  One can rent equipments, like microwave oven, vacuum and treadmill, but be mindful of space and price! There is absolutely no room cleaning. The food is left outside the room on a little stool. Garbage pick up is at 2 PM. They give you one trash bags for garbage and black for linen and towels. For the food containers, you are supposed to wash and keep them, and at the end of the stay, they have a contractor who takes them for recycling. So the pile could get annoying. Be creative and stick them in places you cannot see during the period. The bed, pillows and comforter are very comfortable. But, the bed is about 6 feet long only. So,  anybody taller than, say 5’9, your feet will be dangling off the bed, lol!. During this pandemic period, there are not many people traveling to HK - practically no tourists but those who are visiting families and working here with either new or existing jobs. The health department comes to your room to give you COVID tests, which the hotel will communicate the dates and give you a heads up. Mine was bearable - the worker was quite gentle.

The actual quad room size is about 260 sq ft instead of 440 sq ft as advertised on the hotel web site (We asked family to send measuring tape to actually measure it).  In the name of covid precaution, they put all the pillows into garbage bags instead of zipped pillow cover.  The desk by the bedside is not suitable as a work desk,  one would constantly bump his/her knees into the wall.  And the other foldable desk was not meant for a regular person to use.  You need to stack multiple chairs in order to use it as a work area.  The closet is too small to fit luggages for the family.  The bedsheets were dusty.  One of the family members ended up with a skin infection because of this and had to be admitted to the hospital during the quarantine.  And they want you to sleep with the garbage as they only want to collect it once at 2pm every day (remember breakfast,lunch and dinner are all in the room).

A family member of ours who resides in Hong Kong phoned a few times to ask questions about the quarantining package - mainly if food could be dropped off, and what availabilities were offered for 3 adults sharing the same flight and if they can quarantine together - they offered a few choices and we went for the a family quad room. At the time we were liaising with Angie Ip from Reservations. She was helpful and courteous, and her tone never wavier from friendliness.  She was well informed and addressed our concerns and is one of the reasons we arrived confidently.Upon arriving you need to show HKID or passport, test results (with the stamp) from airport and your reservation. The receptionist was friendly and allowed for delivery of food to be ordered, as we arrived around 8pm. She went through all the information and answered any questions we had. I should say that they notified us when we arrived of a HK$6000 fee on top if you become positive with Covid-19 when you have a test on your 10th day of quarantine, as they would have to implement a disinfecting clean that complied with COVID-19 regulations. The reception desk has a Plexiglas, and you must wear mask at all times. They take your temperature, as well as have a temperature gage near the lifts which you can view on the monitor. It is a small reception area but with high ceilings and brightly lit, and a small concierge desk where deliveries are made - the team are exceptionally friendly, my mum rates them highly!Cannot comment on the restaurant as we did not use it.Our stay was comfortable and clean and we ended up staying in the Premier Suite, where they provided a small dinning table and 3 comfortable swivel chairs! as well as a work desk (we brought in a monitor) All reflecting superior design quality. There is a complimentary water tray with packet instant coffee and tea, cups and glasses. We bought in our own small Nespresso machine and teapot. I would highly recommend doing that, as we had 3 adults working throughout the quarantine. We had a room with a view of Lion Rock(Mountain) On reflection we should have asked them before we entered the room if they could remove the spare bed, as that would have given us more room for an exercise mat. The windows are huge, the room had high ceilings and blackout curtains. This room provided us with 2 flat screen tv - we brought our own HDMI cable and was able to connect our Nintendo switch. The room provides a built in wardrobe that would fit one person's clothing (we had 3!) There is a full length mirror that acts as a slide door to the wardrobe.Breakfast is included - It is delivered everyday between 8:30am-9am and warm. I would say the provision here is below average for a 4 star hotel. One member of our family is wheat and dairy intolerant. There is a weeks rota, which makes it a nicer experience and offers some variation - It's typical cha chaan teng food. Monday: ham egg bun with boil eggTues: wheat noodles with preserved veg in soup, with scramble egg and ham on white breadWed: Pineapple bun and boiled egg (my husband's favourite!)Thurs: Marconi and Charsiu in soup, with scramble egg and spam on white breadFri: Charsiu bun and boiled eggSat: potato salad with ham and cheese sandwichSunday: 3 pieces of fried chicken wings and congee with preserved vegThey provided a small cooling fridge, which we used for perishables, and brought in our own steamer to reheat food. We didn't cook, as the smoke/heat detection and sprinkler system was near.One member of our party had a birthday; we had a cake delivered to the hotel from our family. Dorsett Hotel sent their well wishes with a card and a unique hotel souvenir which was hospitable and received well. (Thank you Sam Tan)Dorsett Hotel provide water upon request, as well as fresh linen and towels. I didn't think to ask for a hoover till the last day, one member of our party has dust allergies, and towards the end of the stay the dust was starting to affect him. The room does come with windows that opened - which we opened at all times - we only used the air-conditioning when showing/bathing as suggested. There is some sort of air purifier or dehumidify in the hallway which is always on. They provide linen bags and rubbish bags on request. They do not provide laundry service but will give you powder, which we used to wash small items.Housekeeping were usually efficient, esp if you request for things in the afternoonThe bathroom was a good size, we requested a room with a bath, which was a good size, the shower had good pressure, and it had a rain feature, which felt great! They provided plenty of shower/bath gels from Elemis. The room has high ceiling and high mirrors. The sink is a good size, I could wash small laundry items like socks and underwear. I could even bit a medium pot under the tap. They provide toilet cleaner, fresh toilet brush, cleaning cloth and scourer.  A vanity set is provided, shower cap, toothbrush, toothpaste, earbuds, comb, shaving kit and nail filer and soap.If I needed to do quarantine again I would be happy to do it here, and recommend it to others - there are many eateries around that do delivery. We used food panda when out family couldn't bring food. I would suggest a budget around $100-150 per person per meal if one was planning to solely depend on food delivery.

My elderly Mother & I travelled back to Hong Kong from UK and were able to stay together in one room (some Hotels required each members to be in separate rooms). We were given a room at the 19th floor with (a slight) seaview, this did make a nice comfortable stay as we could admire the HK view compared to other Hotels which I understand gives you lower floors and you would be staring into other blocks/apartments.Considering it was double occupancy in one room, the space was reasonable ~ even with twin beds we still had room to place our luggage & good size table area for meals. Adequate supplies of toiletries, towels, water bottles, drinks (tea bags, coffee sachets) were provided. All our requests for 'top-ups' during our stay was dealt with very speedily. Hot water and shower pressure was also excellent throughout our stay which I find to be important for a comfy stay. TV channels reception is good and I was very impressed with the speed & stability of the WiFi! Regarding meals ~ basic breakfast was provided, which was interesting in our first week stay, however the selection repeated itself in the second week so we choose to order in. We mainly used Food Panda for our food orders and there is a wide selection of restaurants for this location and the hotel staff are very quick bringing our food up to us (chair outside our room for non contact delivery).Staff member were very friendly and helpful during our stay. Sam Tan, Augustine Cheung, Kevin, Gus and Eric all assisted and responded very quickly to all of our enquiries. They also called us several times to ensure our stay was satisfactory and to provide a quick word of encouragement for our quarantine stay (which I thought was very thoughtful especially for solo guests that may not have had much social interactions with the outside world ^_^)Overall I highly recommend Dorsett Hotel and look forward to staying again once this pandemic is over.

Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong,d1235711,r777024162,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1235711-r777024162-Dorsett_Mongkok_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong.html,"Reviewed November 12, 2020 ",2020,C568ED7D21F3E68E925B1B8642F14657,5,Hotel Quarantino,"I booked the quarantine package, offered at the Dorsett Mong Kok, to complete the mandatory 14-day government quarantine.  There are several options available, however, as a solo traveller, I opted for the 257 sq foot room with a Queen bed.  The package comes complete with a breakfast box.  The quarantine package meets the government requirements, so you'll have no problem passing through the airport process before or after you land in Hong Kong.I found that the hotel is well-versed in handling quarantining passengers, including those who arrive late - if you arrive at the airport after 4 pm you can expect to spend your first night at the pleasure of the Hong Kong government in a hotel of their choosing.  You must still book your full 14-night stay from the date of arrival and there are no refund options.  It is what it is.  When you check in you will notice security in the hotel lobby, as well as a temperature scanner and you will be greeted and checked in promptly to be taken to your room. Something I didn't realise until I arrived was that even via the room, services are entirely restricted - that includes laundry.  As a traveller who didn't have much in the way of clothing, I managed by washing clothes in the sink with the washing detergent provided by the hotel, hanging them to dry in the shower overnight and then in the window during the morning to finish off.  It can be done if necessary.  In terms of other services, the hotel staff expertly handled the removal of rubbish/trash, dirty linen and towels, and safely provided replacements via a small black stool outside of the door. They also have a shopping app where you can purchase refreshments to your room, as well as add-on items such as microwaves, coffee machines and gym equipment (for suites/bigger rooms).  In addition, they permit deliveries from outside restaurants via Food Panda, Deliveroo and alike.  The hotel also provide water and, in my case, they were able to provide extra bottled water, as requested in my booking, which was safely and timely left on a stool outside the room each morning, like other deliveries and replenishment.Whilst I am disappointed that I was not provided with the queen-sized bed I had requested, instead, I was given two twin beds, I have no complaints about the room.  The desk was more than big enough to work at each day and an easy-clean glass that could be kept sanitised.   Although the stool used to sit at the desk was a little low for my height I didn't request an alternative, I am sure they would have tried to provide something else.  The internet, for the most part, worked without complaint. In the 14-days I only had a problem twice whilst using a VPN to watch Amazon Prime, however, without VPN the bandwidth was fast enough even on those occasions.  Throughout my stay, I continue to work and the internet easily handled zoom and teams meetings, accessed apps and tools, allowed me to watch Netflix and amazon prime, etc.  In terms of facilities and storage in the room, there is a safe in the room, housed in one of the cupboards, but given that there's no leaving the room I see no use for it and hence I used it to store snacks.  There was a deep roll-out drawer below for storing clothing, which provides ample space for emptying a few days worth of clothing out of a case.  A small rail also provided some hanging space (3 hangers), which was handy since there wasn't an iron/ironing board in the room.  There was also premium hairdryer supplied in the room, which was perfect since I didn't travel with one!!Whilst the bathroom was small, it is of typical size for hotel rooms in Hong Kong and featured everything that was required, including toiletries, hooks for hanging towels, a (new and sealed) toilet brush, a bottle of toilet duck and ample supply of toilet rolls.  Nonetheless, all supplies are just a phone call away and delivered promptly by the caring and helpful concierge staff.  Next to the bathroom area, a suspended shelf near floor level housed a mini-fridge, large enough for litre-sized cartons of milk (you can purchase milk from the 7-11 or M & S through Deliveroo, or bring your own milk alternative in your suitcase, per customs requirements, as I did).  Above the fridge, on an easy-clean glass shelf, was a kettle and tea/coffee supplies, along with two small mugs.  If you're a prolific tea/coffee drinker like me - bring a bigger mug or you'll be spending a lot of time boiling the kettle!! I would also bring your favourite tea/coffee (and snacks) to make your stay more comfortable - you will underestimate how difficult 14-days in a confined space (especially by yourself) is.In terms of the view, I had an east pointing room overlooked the highway and Tai Kok Tsui below.  A large window looks out towards towering blocks of apartments in the distance and mountains behind them - a beauty at day and night.  Right next to the hotel is a school, leisure centre, wet market and playground so there is plenty of people watching to keep you from boredom.  The buildings are also vibrant - painted in the rainbow colours, so in terms of mental health, I found them to be a positive driver each morning when I opened the curtains.The final part of the stay comes down to the care and attention from the staff.  Whilst I did have an issue getting through on the telephone initially, it was promptly rectified by providing me with a list of speed dial numbers to try and I didn't have any further problems.  I should also mention that I didn't continuously try to call so it may be that the staff were simply busy dealing with customers when I had called.  Nonetheless, Sam and Augustine (Assistant Managers) would regularly call (daily during week 1 and every other day by week 2) to check how I was doing.  I think this is an important feature of the service given the isolation, but also testament to the staffs capabilities to know how and when to bother guests, versus ensuring the health and wellbeing of those in confinement.  They handled it expertly; I generally don't like to be bothered but on the otherhand I suffer with depression.If you're considering a quarantine stay at the Dorsett Mong Kok, you'll no doubt have lots of questions, worries and concerns.  Nothing will prepare you for quarantining in a room 24/7 for 14-days, but having gone through the experience here, having had many worries and uncertainties before I arrived, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Dorsett to others for their stay.  You can opt for expensive hotels and plush rooms, as I was considering too, but the outcome is the same.  Having found out that we are not allowed to use hotel facilities of any kind, to have minimal contact, highly restricted services and 100% confinement, why bother paying double when you can have a trusted, safe stay here.",1,"dear valued guest, thank you for your valuable comments. we are delighted to know that overall you enjoyed your stay at our hotel. we will definitely pass your generous compliments to our staff and keep them motivated. while it would have been great to learn more about your stay experience, we will as always continue to improve our service to ensure you a better stay on your next return. once again, thank you for staying at dorsett mongkok, hong kong. we look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the near future.","Responded November 12, 2020","hotel quarantino i booked the quarantine package, offered at the dorsett mong kok, to complete the mandatory 14-day government quarantine.  there are several options available, however, as a solo traveller, i opted for the 257 sq foot room with a queen bed.  the package comes complete with a breakfast box.  the quarantine package meets the government requirements, so you'll have no problem passing through the airport process before or after you land in hong kong.i found that the hotel is well-versed in handling quarantining passengers, including those who arrive late -

On Aug 24, 2020, I had booked and paid for this property for 21 nights in November. The booking agent sent an email to me on Sep 12 quoting that this property wants to know if my stay is for quarantine purposes. If so, I would need to use the Quarantine Package and will be a different price. And the more interesting part is the email specifically mentioned ""whole period of room rate will be charged as penalty if no show"". (I don't understand what that really means, but whatever.)I am quite shock at the content of this mail and the logic is beyond me.First issue - I have paid the room for 21 nights and quarantine is 14 nights, so that does not add up.Second issue - I find the whole questioning of my purpose of stay is too personal.Third issue - Now I cannot stop thinking if I need to report my daily activities to prove that I am not there for quarantine stay. This becomes a privacy issue. Honestly, flying 16-hours from Canada, half way around the world, I have no interest to get kicked out or forced to pay a higher rate after I arrived.No matter what the Hotel's original intention is, this type of wording in the email is totally upsetting at best and probably infringe on my privacy. A better way is to declare/publish the room rate is not intended for quarantine purposes before accepting booking. Then customer like me can take the measure into our own hands to agree before making the booking. Sending an email afterwards to question my purpose is so ridiculous. And I have never seen this in my 30 years of travel.I have actually called the property and spoke to an agent on the phone. She indicated that if HK Government continues with the 14-day quarantine measures in November, my stay will be considered as quarantine stay. My point is that my intention to stay is not for quarantine but if HK Government still has that requirement in November, then it is beyond my control. What they are really telling me is that I would have to assume the full risk of this future event.To mitigate this risk, I would now have to cancel this reservation, try to get a refund and find another property that will accept my business. Really looking forward to this extra work!!",1,"dear guest,thank you for sharing your comment with us. while we value your feedback on this, we’d like to seek your kind understanding that our top priority is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of every guest and staff in our hotel, which is why it is necessary for us to take extra precautionary steps to make sure all bookings are handled with the utmost discretion. since every inbound traveler to hong kong is required to undergo a 14-day quarantine, it is mandatory to ask if our guests are staying for quarantine purpose as we do have other guests staying with us for a long period of time, but not for quarantine purpose, we apologize if you find this question too personal for you. to address your concerns - no, we will not question our guests’ daily activities during their stay, this is not our usual practice, but knowing they are here for 14-day quarantine in advance enables us to prepare ahead and offer additional assistance during their entire stay since they are not allowed to leave the room for 14 days; we will not reject an entry if the booking has been confirmed (unless guests show signs of illness upon check-in, we will seek medical assistance immediately), nor will we ask our guests to pay a higher rate.that said, though, we will definitely review the wording of our email and be sure to include a clear explanation of the objective of asking the purpose of the stay, and to state the extra items/services and safety assurance we will provide for our guests who are staying for 14-day quarantine (hence the difference in price of the quarantine package you mentioned), as well as the cancellation policy to avoid upsetting our guests. once again, sorry for the inconvenience caused, we look forward to welcoming you at dorsett mongkok in the future.  thank you.

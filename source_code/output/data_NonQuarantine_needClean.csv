The room was VERY small, too small for even two people.  There was no phone in the room in case you needed to talk to the front desk.  The toilet is IN the shower, the area just outside the shower with the sink floods because no drainage, and the shower leaked badly. There wasn’t even any instant coffee/tea, breakfast was EXTRA cost. The drawers did not close. If the noisy dehumidifier wasn’t running 24 hrs the room turned into a slippery hazard! There was a mosquito killing machine that did NOTHING, lots of mosquitoes in the room. The room itself showed TOO MANY examples of less than adequate build quality. (Like holes cut by what look like 6 year olds to make space for bathroom pipes.) For the amount of money we paid, we expected more than just being close to the beach. To say that the accommodations were basic are a HUGE understatement. For over US$100/night, NOT WORTH IT!I can go on to talk about the terrible food as well, but at this point I think you can figure that out.",0,NaN,NaN

Our room was small (which we don’t mind), however we paid more for an executive room but the bed was smaller than a double bed and situated sideways against a wall in the middle of the room. It  was hard, small and uncomfortable, esp being 6ft 4.The pillows were thin and the towels were the thinnest I’ve ever seen. The room was full of unnecessary clutter and random cupboards/drawers and this made it feel even smaller. Two huge photographs on the wall made us feel like we had stepped back into 1975.The communal staircase was shabby and dirty and the AstroTurf on the landings was grubby.We just didn’t want to stay in the room any longer than we had to which was fine for one night but we definitely don’t want to stay again, and our friends who stayed with us feel the same. It’s such a shame because the facade of the building is beautiful as is the location. This hotel really needs a revamp..!!",0,NaN,NaN

A beach is just next to the hotel and is peaceful, beautiful, with the Tsing Yi Bridge just above my head!The room is clean, spacious with a podium. Bed very cozy. Everything functional. Some areas require improvement:1) I hung the ""no disturb"" plate outside my door when I left. More than once, they called me and asked if I needed cleaning up. I think they don't have to call guests (a kind of disturbance to me) for confirmation when the no-disturb sign already tells2) I found 3 cockroaches    , 1 alive 2 died, next to my sliding door in the podium. I dare not stay in the podium or open my door 3) TV channels are too limited. There are some more local free channels but not available here. Transport is fine as there are ferry, buses connecting to the Ma Wan island.Restaurants are very few on the island, 4 western cuisine along the beach.

A front desk staff named Nancy check us in and her attitude was bad. She give us a room confirmation paper with only the correct guest name, all other information were wrong. Well, that’s not a problem as I understand they were so busy. However, the wrong confirmation letter stated that we booked twin bed room instead of the a large bed room. Nancy not willing to admit her fault that she found us a wrong confirmation paper while all of the information inside were wrong obviously and said that she can provide us with double bed room for special, no more high floor as she only do according to what confirmation letter stated. Of course she’s not saying the above sentence in a good attitude for sure. Finally, she put us into a low floor and just opposite to a elevator. I’m not sure it’s coincidence or Nancy did it on purpose. It make me feel so bad during my whole trip.I wonder why I’m coming for staycation, but seems like I’m coming for being insulted. Actually, with a cheap price and the room is not too bad. But with the bad service from Nancy and ruined my holiday, it make me so hard to return again and recommend to others.I hope you agree with me that this type of service is completely unacceptable at so many levels. It is not the kind of treatment I would have expected from a normal hotel. I am very disappointed from this bitter experience.

This boutique hotel is situated in a convenient SoHo location with no shortage of cafes, restaurants and bars. It took us a walk of about 10 minutes to get here from Central station.The room was generously sized and decked out with glamorous decorations. It had a separate living room and a small kitchenette. It also had a microwave, built-in washing machine and dryer which were a pleasant surprise. Drinks and snacks at the mini bar were complimentary although there was no room service. By the kitchenette, the bar counter was a good place for us to enjoy some drinks while admiring the view. It only had one barstool though, so it would be better to have two. Bedroom was cozy and comfortable. It had blackout curtains which did a fantastic job of blocking the morning sunlight for us to sleep in. Bathroom was as spacious as the rest of the room and nicely designed with blue-white tiles. The entire suite would be completed if there was also a study desk.Not much service was provided, just basic check-in and check-out which were simple and speedy.

I was in a separate block apart from the main resort building, which was great. The room was spacious with 2 beds (bigger than single but didn't look as big as a double) and a sliding door window (which didn't open) looking onto the ocean, which was beautiful. Except for the 3 main lights (bathroom, passage outside bathroom, 1 wall light opposite beds), none of the others (2 bedside lamps, 1 standing lamp, 1 desk lamp) worked. Luckily it was enough light for me to use my laptop at night, but inconvenient and did not give a great impression of care. The carpets had marks on them and the decor is old and outdated. The saving grace is the beautiful sea view onto Silvermine beach.There were tv channels that showed only English or Chinese options, and others that showed that it could be in either English or Chines. When I tried using a channel advertised in English or Chinese and couldn't do it and called reception to find out how to change it to English, I was told that it couldn't be done. No point in printing it could be in either English or Chinese, when in fact that wasn't the case.The vegetarian breakfast was not terribly good - very standard quality. Others who had breakfast at the sea facing restaurant with me did not enjoy the quality of the pork sausage and ham (very processed and low quality) or the bread, but the lady who served us (Gloria) is lovely, charming and friendly. The grounds are quite nice and had facilities been open it may have been better, but due to covid 19 regulations, wasn't. The reception staff were friendly enough and I was given permission to leave my bicycle inside the perimeter of the resort locked up, which was kind (as there is signage very clearly stating that this is not allowed).My niece ended up not staying with me after all, and I was told by reception that generally, they do not allow only 1 person to stay in a room, and it has to be 2 people or more. I find this so odd, as I am a single woman and have often booked into hotels on my own. Penalized for being single? Ridiculous!!!Would I stay there again? Of course I would have to find someone to stay with, as I don't see them changing policy just to accommodate singles :) So the answer is: No, I won't stay there again.",0,NaN,NaN

They basically lied to agoda saying the rooms were full just because they didn't want to honour their original pricing and wanted to cancel on me and raise the price for the market! This kind of dishonest behaviour is filthy and money oriented instead of honesty. Everyone beware booking this hotel in the future as they might change their mind and cancel on you in the last minute and make up rubbish reasons. They really think the consumers are dumb and can't check themselves....In my 10 years of using agoda I've never seen a hotel this dishonest and cash greedy to the core!,0,NaN,NaN

Few hotels in Hong Kong offer as many advantages and attractions as The Charterhouse, especially at such an unreal and unbeatable price!  Whatever your purpose ~ business, pleasure, tourism, shopping & food, etc ~ you will find The Charterhouse's location to be remarkably strategic ~ everything you want and need, right at your fingertips!  Please allow me to take you now on a quick tour, beginning inside The Charterhouse, then moving outward into our beloved, fascinating Hong Kong!Your room speaks warmly of cozy Old English ~ refreshingly high ceilings; rustic, rounded, wooden desk & cabinets; and a varnished bedside table & nightstand.  Tasteful ivory-colored, gold-brimmed lamps abound, so that your choices of lighting are plentiful as they are beautiful.  Your room's walls are thick & guarded, ideal for privacy and quiet reflection.  In fact, with the drapes shut and the lights out, nothing could make for better shut-eye!  As for your view:  one large window, robed with sheer curtains and heavy drapes, awaits your advance.  Undress it before the southern exposure, and behold:  Hong Kong's stunning, precipitous mountains, all punctuated by buildings of enthralling variety and dimension!  And get ready for the night:  this intriguing display turns luminously intoxicating ~ almost other-worldly!  And as for the mountains:  clad thickly with jungle and secret trails, they reach bravely into heavenly heights, where gentle mists, wandering clouds, and island breeze drift lazily over ridge and peak, hailing from such choice getaways as Stanley Market, Deep Water Bay, and Shek O.  Exiting your room, you will find literally all the hotel staff to be unbelievably exceptional ~ from the housekeeping staff, to the front desk and management crew (level three), to the concierge attendants below (ground level)!  Exit The Charterhouse, and immediately to your right is a key, strategic bus stop, which facilitates quick arrival to coveted destinations and areas throughout Hong Kong Island!  Pacific Place Shopping Centre is one such place, and its comprehensive, international supermarket, Great Food Hall (Basement level 1~ includes dine-in & dine-out options) is something you certainly don't want to miss out on!A mere seven-minute stroll from The Charterhouse will take you to Hong Kong's Happy Valley Racecourse, where you can conveniently catch busses to such charming places as Stanley Market, Ocean Park, and Central's Mid~Levels (home to countless restaurant-, cuisine- and cafe-choices)!  Incidentally, Times Square, Sogo, the HK Island trams, and Victoria Park (including its inviting marina & boardwalk), are also just within minutes' walking distance from The Charterhouse!  A similar length's walk in the other direction will take you to the Wan Chai MTR, and just beyond that, to the Wan Chai Ferry!  A delightful, scenic 10-min ferry ride across the Victoria Harbour is all it takes to get you to HK's famous waterfront promenade, Avenue of Stars ~ the cool and lively welcoming forefront of Hong Kong's historic Kowloon Peninsula!  As for food, cafes, and shopping near The Charterhouse, the variety and number of choices available to you are endless!  That being said, you might want to start with Coffee Academics right next door, or perhaps Pacific Coffee just down the way and across the street!  7-Elevens, by the way, are as common here as sparrows!I'd like now to give special thanks to the following Charterhouse staff for daily making me feel at home, especially during this challenging holiday season:  at the front desk ~ Chris (Manager), Damon, Anna, Crystal, Connie, Coco, and Brian; of the Housekeeping staff ~ Ava, Feng, and Cola; and of the Concierge attendants ~ Jason, Edmund, Wing, Ming, Ken, Henry, Ben, and Ms. Wong.

Very convenient. It's next to Hong Kong Stadium where concerts are held. So it's a good idea to stay here after watching concerts till 11pm. I believe the main guest source is mainland China. But in these Covid days, no tourists came. So the guests are mainly locals for the time being. There's a shopping centre under the hotel with some choices of restaurants and food court with very good and cheap food for lunch or dinner (HKD36 a plate of rice with soup for my dinner on the first night of stay). There's supermarket and convenience store in the shopping centre. So everything available and convenient. My room is on 16/F. The interior is functional but very old fashion, aged, just like a typical 3-star grand hotel in mainland China. Don't expect very clean. I stayed for 3 nights and only required cleaning on the third day. Yet I found the used tissue paper and the packing of finished snack were still on the desk, mixed up with my clothes. The used glass and cups were not replaced either. I therefore called the staff to reflect my observations (not a complaint, just notification). The staff was very nice and offered to come to my room to clean it up. I said no need as I could do it myself. The setting in the room is not good with its TV set on one side which means my head was always kept to the right when watching. Bed very small, pillows with some stains that appears not washable. Not smelly though. Room sufficient lightings. Air con strong with some noise. Provisions sufficient in room. Hair dryer, kettle, slippers, toiletries, towels, fridge, tea bags. But no safe as I recalled. Bathroom with bathtub. Shower on it. Shower strong and hot. Very good. I didn't try the buffet which looks not bad. Full on weekends. After all, it's aged and tired hotel and room. Yet it's acceptable to me still. It recalls my good memories when traveling in mainland China. Good feel.

When there was a Typoon 8 on the day we had to check out and were not sure if our flight would be cancelled, she stayed even though it was time for her to get off work to make sure my young child and I were doing fine and could get to the airport on time.  She even anticipated what we would need and facilitated without us requesting.  Her hospitality was incredible and made us feel calm and taken good care of.  I thank all the staff for making our stay as comfortable and welcome as could be, especially Miss Tung's professional and personable service.",1,"Dear JPF52,Thank you for continuous support and we are pleased to learn you have such a pleasant stay with us, particularly glad to see our staff could make such a positive impact on your staying experience.

Very accessible and very big shopping mall nearby with lots of dining options! I must say, I'm quite impressed with the room. It was really clean, no moldy smell and really spacious! I was given a complimentary upgrade to a City Cornerview Room! Really appreciate and was happy about it. I had a nice city view with partial seaview at the side since the room had a panoramic glass windows! Kuddos to Chloe Tung for the great hospitality and swift check-in process. Despite the busy situation at the lobby, she was very thorough and maintained her professionalism. She was very nice to us! Thanks Chloe! Special thanks to Ada Chan (Housekeeper) on the 32/F for assisting in setting up the extra bed and sending up extra amenities. She was very kind to us. If the room was done by her, it needs some credits! Pls send my thanks to her! Regarding the buffet, they have ample choices. It's not the best compared to my other hotel experiences but it does cover the basics. I think the hotel could consider adding few more main course dishes (lunch buffet). There was only a few of them on the buffet table.  Wanted to swim in their pool but unfortunately HK Observatory issued thunderstorm warning signal in the 2 days I stayed, so no chance of swimming. Too bad haha My family and I walked around the hotel to check out their facilities, we happen to walk by the 47/F which was a bar & restaurant. They had a nice rooftop with outdoor furniture where you can relax. It had a nice ambiance! Overall, my experience was splendid!

That turned out to be incorrect. When we checked in at 3 pm, we soon realised that we had a mistake and even contemplated going back home and coming back to the park next morning. The restaurants were all full which turned out to be a blessing because the room service we were forced to order was just awful. The menu is not at all kid friendly- I could not find any snacks for kids on it so had to order snacks meant for adults to go with wine as part of a ‘chill ax’ package. The red wine they sent was a 2020 from Chile so I didn’t bother opening it. The snacks were very poor quality - extremely greasy chicken nuggets with barely any chicken in them so we decided to go to DB for dinner. The service was not bad but the room is tired and depressing and there really isn’t much joy in the hotel. The breakfast the next day was really grim as well. And there really didn’t seem to be any big benefit of staying in the hotel- I was hoping they would allow us to visit the park both days so we could see it in the evening and in the day but they only allow you one day entry which kind of makes the hotel stay pointless.",1,"Dear Saurav J,Thank you for your recent stay at our hotel and taking the time to provide a candid feedback of your staying experience.We terribly regret to hear of your unpleasant stay at our hotel with the mentioned issues.

Long story short, this hotel is located at one of the very convenient place (5-7mins walking distance from Sheung Wan sta.) in Hong Kong Island and yet offers a very reasonable price and good quality service.Below I have summarises points that may be of interest for someone who is considering Travelodge as an option.Desk/work space: depending on the layout of the room, you may find the space somewhat limited. For me, the space was enough to use laptop and ipad.Laundry: no laundry machine in the room but there are several self laundry service facilities  (1min walk) and shops that offers you laundry service (3mins walk). Travel lodge also offers the service but cost slightly higher than the street.Room service: you’ll have the room and the bed cleaned up 2 times every week and you’ll also get numbers of bottle of waters replenished each time. I find this extremely convenient for a single man like me who is extremely lazy for such things.Utility: apparently it is all free. Given high humidity in Hong Kong, I had kept my room’s air conditioner on for 24 hours to keep the room condition decent and avoid having my clothes and leather shoes go moody (for no cost).Daily necessities / restaurant S : there are multiple Seven Elevens (24hrs open), drag stores, super markets and diverse types of restaurants in 1-5mins working distant. No stress in shopping and foods.Fridge: no freezer and very compact fridge in the room. Given the size of it, you may not expect to keep too many stuffs in it but as mentioned above, supermarket is nearby, so I can easily stop by the supermarket to fulfil your needs at the time of needs.Others:  only the negative that I may had with Travelodge was the quality of the soundproof. I have to say it is extremely poor as if there is no wall in between your neighbour. This however was not a huge problem with me as I was out for work all day and I’d slept in bed with headsets, but I imagine it could be very frustrating for some people. Above all, I am very satisfied with Travelodge. Concierge is always nice, very attentive and supportive. I had a very pleasant stay here and I’m most likely use it next time again when I come back to Hong Kong.Hope the above helps for to the consideration!",1,"Dear KentaroF,Thank you for your comments and we are happy to know that you had a great stay with us.

Check in time is 3:30pm, and it was a breeze. As an HP member, we were given 2 vouchers/room for welcome drinks in the Waterfront Bar and Terrace. And cakes were served in the room. Receptionist are nice and welcoming.The Room-We got a harbourview room and it was nice.. We got an unobstructed view of the sea which is very calming. The room is clean and well appointed. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Bathroom is spotless and water pressure is good. The Pool-We were informed that we can only book the swimming pool after we checked in. By the time we called the Fitness Center it was already fully booked for the day. There are 12 sessions per day, 50 minutes each, from 8am- 8:50pm and there was no availability. I was quite disappointed because the kids are looking forward to swim, and the next available time is in the next morning which is my child’s graduation day. Fortunately we are booked for 2 nights and we were able to get a slot at 8 a.m. (because that is the only available time) on the day of our check out, which is the 3rd day. So if the purpose of your stay is to enjoy the swimming pool, You should manage your expectations.Waterfront Bar and Terrace-My family and I went here on our 2nd night and we were approach by a staff named Ben, he asked us if we have reservation, I told him we don’t have any and we would like to order some food and use the welcome drink vouchers. He didn’t seem pleased and looked rather irritated. We were seated outside and the guests on the next table were smoking so I called Ben again and asked him if we could move to another table because we have kids, and he said in a high tone almost yelling “You can sit wherever you want, I have something else to do!” I am quite shocked considering that this is a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. He wast just on his phone texting… very rude. Even my kids heard him and were surprised by the outburst. It is a shame for someone like my husband who is working in the hospitality business for 25 years to witness such a very poor customer service. Very unprofessional, that’s how you treat your paying guests, seriously? The other waitress on the other hand was very apologetic, and she’s the one who served us instead.

This ain't luxury or grand hotel. It is located on the 16th floor of Chungking Mansion, which by itself, has a very seedy reputation. But if we're talking about location, then this is gold. Located along Nathan Road for shopping. A few blocks away from Avenue of the Stars and Star Ferry, and accessible via MTR. Lots of food choices around Chungking Mansion. Iconic Filipino-based fastfood Jollibee is just across the street. This is where we get our breakfast as it opens really early, compared to the other establishments. As for the sleeping accommodations, can be compared to the really low-end motor hotels. Quite cramped and walls are thin. You can hear the guests from your neighboring room. If they are snoring, then good luck. If they are smoking, you are better off to another hotel. We stayed right around the time when protests are being held. With our window facing Nathan Road, we have a birds-eye view of the protests and eventual dispersing of the protestors. Bathroom is as big as a portalet. Just imagine placing a toilet, a sink and a shower in that much of a space. Not the most friendly front desk either. No breakfast here but I wouldn't want to given the availability of food from outside.Will I book another night here? You'd be surprised I'd still say yes.

The staff at the restaurant (Daniel) is amazing and kind.  We really enjoyed our experience with Daniel and the beach.  However, there were a number of issues.  First, the sheets had stains (urine and other unmentionable secretions) and human hair on them, and as soon as I checked in, I needed to get those changed in my child's room.  They changed them but asked a lot of questions before they did (which I thought was really wierd; just change the sheets!).  Then, when I went to sleep in my own room, I found dirt and hair in my bed. Since the staff had gone to sleep, I just slept with the dirt and other people's hair.  The beds were literally hard as a rock and the pillows were also.  We all had a hard time sleeping due to the hardness of the bed and pillows, and other guests we knew who stayed there agreed.  When we woke up and went down for breakfast (which only started at 9 am) it was just okay.  However, what really angered me is that they 1) ask how many people will be at breakfast the next day but do not tell you the breakfast was not included in the price (yes, it's in the fine print in your reservation but every other hotel I've ever stayed in tells you again!); then 2) don't serve breakfast unless you request it,  3) do not state the breakfast price on the menu and 4) surprise you with a bill when you check out for people who are staying there x $80, even if they didn't order breakfast!!   I have been back and forth with the hotel explaining that we didn't even order 5 breakfasts but were charged for them; that they didn't even serve 5 breakfasts but charged us for them.  They keep telling me that they'll train their staff better, but all I want is my money back for services not rendered.   Honestly, I've lived in HK for 17 years and travelled around the world and have never had any hotel act like this.  I was very surprised by the fact that they would not back down on this - they took my money and didn't provide any service for it.  They asked me why I wanted my sheets changed when there was human secretions, dirt and hair on them....Other travellers should be aware of this SCAM and consider staying in another hotel.

Like all HK hotels on the beaches, the design and fittings are 'hodge podge, and the prices at weekends do not reflect particular value for money, but you are paying for location and the fact they can charge this as there are hardly any competitors.My recommendation to the owners is upgrade to a decent standard (rooms feel slightly like being in a secure hospital unit) have a bit more pride in the rooms (not many people like Swan wallpaper in 2020) and remember why you bought a hotel in the first place: surely not just about cash, but making sure Hong Kongers have a nice time on a short break.",0,NaN,NaN

For a weekday overnight, only HK$1,280.The whole premise including the dining area was very dated.  The beautiful sea view from the restaurant was blocked by the security shade which seemed to be permanently shut in fear of sudden gale wind. Nevertheless, since it is the only hotel of this scale on the island, business seems to be very secured.Given it was still in the midst of a pandemic, we got to have a sea view room. The shower was very average and the drain needed to be cleared to save from flooding. No bathtub. The in-room amenities matched the decor. The balcony seating was very tight.  The sea view was fantastic. The curtains block out all lights effectively.  But the aircon was super cold and there was no way to adjust the temperature.

Overall it was a mixed experience, with the view and location being the real highlights but the bathroom being a let-down. I will start with the positives. POSITIVES:1. The views from a balcony room are outstanding. The view is directly over the main beach and across the South China Sea. From our room we were able to see the sea on both sides of the island - it was stunning. During the evening the lights of Hong Kong and Kowloon sparkled in the distance. This was the highlight of our stay.2. Location is very convenient. It couldn't have been better. You are right on the main beach (although having said that, nothing is far from anything in Cheung Chau).3. Even with luggage, it is an easy, flat walk (5-10 min) from the ferry terminal. However there is a steep ramp or steps once you get to the hotel. 3. The balcony is tiny but they are designed to capture maximum view. If staying here, I'd recommend a balcony and sea-view room because this is the main reason for staying here at all. 4. Special 'staycation' deals are frequently on offer during the covid-19 pandemic. 5. Breakfast was very basic but had both Chinese and Western style food on offer. Eggs and omelettes were cooked to order and they did very nice runny eggs when we asked for this. We had breakfast included and went to the breakfast room each day although you can also have it served to your room for a balcony breakfast.6. Wifi was OK for our purposes which was just checking messages etc (not streaming)7. Bed was comfortable and the room was light and bright.NEGATIVES:1. Our bathroom had black mould in the grouting, behind the silicon and on some surfaces like the door. A wooden panel was loose and fell off.  Hot water was good and we had no problem with this but basically the bathroom needs a good overhaul.2. Some maintenance work in the common areas was going on so large areas of carpet are covered in boards and there were several random buckets placed in hallways.3. The room was not made up during our stay. One day, new soap and shampoo appeared in the bathroom but this was the only sign that anyone had been in the room.4. Décor is dated. 5.

So this review is in that context. Firstly, I was allocated room 11 on floor 18. If you get allocated room 11 don’t accept it, the window is tiny and the room feels like a prison cell. The rooms are ok and the best features are the clean and comfortable bed and the water pressure in the shower. The shower is not large but is sufficient but note that the water takes quite a while to heat up. The room has a TV but the choice of channels is limited, no major international stations to watch. There’s a Bluetooth clock/speaker, Aircon, minibar fridge (empty), closet, safe, tea/coffee/kettle (supplies are limited so you may want to bring your own). A few of points to note:-The hotel is close to a major traffic junction and so if you are sensitive to noise at night beware. There is major construction going on next to the hotel currently with large cranes which operate from around 8am to 6pm on weekdays, I’m not sure about weekends.The hotel seems to charge for everything considered ‘extra’. Currently all bars and restaurants in Hong Kong close at 6pm due to coronavirus restrictions so if you’re on a staycation you need to order a food delivery. If you want the hotel to to provide a plate, knife/fork, wine glass etc, the hotel will charge you. If you want more water bottles than the daily allocation the hotel will charge you. The amounts are not significant but the principle of charging for everything extra is very annoying and outdated; where’s the spirit of customer service in this hotel? It doesn’t seem to exist here.

However, I managed to celebrate a memorable Christmas Eve with all my family members at Gloucester Luk Kwok (GLK) Hotel. The HKSAR government announced an extension of social distancing measures until January 6, 2021 just before Christmas. In other words, the current rule about public gatherings (i.e. only two people are allowed to gather in public) and ban on dining services after 6pm remained unchanged during Christmas time and this obviously affected our Seasonal Cheer Staycation Package at GLK Hotel. What is more, the cupcake making class (which was included in our package) was cancelled due to the current social distancing measures. Special thanks should go to Mr. Ray Hon (from the Reservation Department) who suggested to offer us five Fresh Cream Cakes (1 pound each) or Black Forest Cakes (1 pound each) for the replacement of the cupcake making class. After taking the health and needs of our family members into consideration, Ray proposed to upgrade our our five superior rooms to premier rooms on the 25th floor instead of offering five cakes to us. We appreciated Ray’s care of us very much.The change in our room type obviously allowed all ten of us to enjoy room service for our 4-hour “Unique Japanese Cuisine” All-You-Can-Eat Christmas Dinner comfortably in five very spacious and specially decorated rooms. Needless to say, the food was really good but most importantly, I would like to extend my gratitude to the two staff members from Le Menu for their wonderful service provided to my family members throughout the evening. Not only did I need to reserve 5 rooms for my family members to enjoy themselves during Christmas, I had to reserve 5 tables for two for my family so that they could have dim sum on Christmas morning. Thanks to the staff at Canton Room for helping us to reserve 5 tables between 10am and 12noon even though the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Day. The staff were really caring for the fact that their service to us was of the highest quality. The must-eat dishes include assorted dim sum platter, baked mini egg tarts, barbecue pork with liver, beef congee with preserved and salted eggs and fried rice noodles with scallops.",1,"Dear 735aal,We have taken note of your positive comments which we will share it with all our staff via their department heads.

I was upon request given a room on high floor (27/F) with good views of container terminal and bridge. The room is very basic, simple with wise design to increase surface area eg pulling table from wardrobe. One has to bring his own toiletries otherwise has to buy (I love this to save the earth). There's fridge (seem not functional), hangers, cups, green tea bags, disposable slippers, kettle. The room is small and with musty smell. When there're people next door or nearby smoking, I got it too. I think it came via the ventilation system I have to keep the air conditioner on and high to reduce the nasty smell. Amidst this Covid-19 time, it's not a comfy experience to have such musty and smoky smell. Hygiene condition is not desirable here. I could see the mold in the shower room. Bed is comfy and cleanliness of coverings/pillow a mere pass. The location is not bad. There's a shopping arcade with some restaurants and a supermarket nearby. There're two minibuses going to Kwai Fong and Tsing Yi metro stations which have big malls, lots of restaurants, shops and cinemas. The ride is short, within 10 mins. Not many choices of TV channels, mainly locals. Guests are mostly, if not all, local people as tourists won't come in such coronavirus days. I believe this hotel used to serve mainland Chinese tourists. There's a long long and good-looking swimming pool commonly shared by this hotel with the two hotels and the residential estates all next to it and belonging to same estate developer. Unfortunately the pool was not open yet during my stay. Service so so. Didn't expect much. Overall the price is great here, but you have to bear the undesirable hygene situation. At such price, I had ever and could stay in many other hotels which are much more tidy and clean in prime location. ",0,NaN,NaN

In the past 8 months, I stayed in Taiwan, Thailand and Myanmar due to  my work.In fear and  for a long journey, I decided to return to my original place: Hong Kong. I was absolutely delighted, staying in the first isolation hotel for 14 days. After another month, I decided to move and look around for a hotel that suits me better!Under the Covid 19 epidemic, my requirements for hotels are air circulation and cleanliness in the rooms! I am satisfied with the work of the room cleaners! It's just that under the epidemic, the management knows the cleaners about the bacteria of Covid 19! The floor of the room is designed with carpets (and the supply of slippers is stopped!), people will pay attention to the cleaning workers who wear shoes and work in the room to bring bacteria. So I need to prepare a lot of disinfectant spray. I spray once a day to protect the cleaning workers, and spray once to protect myself when I come back to the room.I think the greatest asset of this hotel is the staff at the lobby counter! It is because of their conversational attitude, politeness, work experience, understanding the mood of the guests in the Covid 19 epidemic, and the team spirit in the hotel lobby.This  is definitely represents a respectful image to serve guests and interact with other departments!Therefore, it attracted me to renew my stay at Agoda Booking from one month to two months, and another month...The staff at the lobby counter give me a very profound and happy interactive hotel experience.and thank you for all housekeepers ！Mr.CHEUNG (Room408 )",1,"Dear MuMingWe are honoured that you have chosen Stanford Hillview Hotel for your months long business trip to HK under the epidemic.

However, after our experience this time, we will certainly never come back. When I checked in, I asked the staff, Mr. Dennis Dulay, if it is possible for us to have the same room that we had before as we really liked it. He explained that it was an upgrade to a Deluxe Room at that time, and I only booked a Superior Room this time. He said the hotel has upgraded us twice already and he cannot give any more upgrades this time. After consulting with my boyfriend, I informed Mr. Dulay that I will continue the check in, and he assigned me to Room 1247, which he said is a Superior Room. Upon entering Room 1247, it was clearly much smaller than the rooms we stayed in before. I checked my room booking on Trip.com, as well as Regal Kowloon Hotel’s official site, and found out that the Superior Room was advertised as 28sqm (301sqft). This room was clearly much smaller than 28sqm. I had measuring tape in my luggage as we were going furniture shopping recently, and upon measuring the room which was rectangular, it was 3.3m on the window side and 6m from the door to the window. That means the room size is 19.8sqm, almost 100sqft smaller than advertised! I immediately called Reception to clarify; however, the phone rang for 15 mins straight without anyone answering (from around 5:40pm – 5:55pm). Even the phone operator picked up twice to apologize for the long waiting. It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon, so I could not understand why Reception staff can be so busy that they cannot pick up the phone for 15 mins. I called again at around 6:40pm and was finally able to reach a Reception staff. I explained that upon checking the room size and photos as advertised on the website, it is clear that the room I am in is much smaller and not the room type advertised. The staff insisted that the room is 28sqm, despite clear evidence on my end that it could not be. He then said he will get back to me. Around half an hour later, Mr. Dulay and another staff came to the room to discuss. At this point, Mr. Dulay’s attitude was very unpleasant. He insisted that the hotel cannot keep giving us upgrades, that “you only booked the cheapest room” and “you cannot have no comment when you get a bigger room but complain when you get a smaller room”. The issue here is not about whether I get any upgrades. I am perfectly happy to stay in a Superior Room if the Superior Room is the same size as advertised. However, if the hotel has falsely advertised the room size and it ends up almost 100sqft smaller, then it is only fair and legal that we get a room which is the same size as what we paid for. Mr. Dulay ended the conversation by saying he will give us an upgrade this time but will mark down in my file that I will never have any more upgrades if I come to this hotel again. Throughout the whole conversation, Mr. Dulay and the other hotel staff have not once apologized for the false room advertising. Mr. Dulay’s tone and attitude was extremely unpleasant. He treated me like a criminal who consistently harasses the hotel for upgrades and nitpicks at small details to get an upgrade. Nowhere in the conversation did Mr. Dulay welcome me back to the hotel again. I perfectly understood and accept that I could not be upgraded this time; however, this is clearly a major issue for misleading consumers to pay for a 28sqm room, and then giving them a 19.8sqm room. When we entered Room 507, the room smelt strongly of cigarettes and was clearly poorly maintained. On most of the nights during our one week stay, the bathtub drain kept gurgling loudly throughout the night. The sounds went on and off and kept repeating for the whole night. One night, it was so loud that my boyfriend and I were kept awake till around 2am, when we were finally able to fall asleep from exhaustion. We considered informing the hotel about this, but when we remembered Mr. Dulay’s poor attitude, we did not want to raise the issue just for Mr. Dulay to say that we were asking for more upgrades again. We did not trust that the hotel would deal with the issue and decided to tolerate it until we leave. I hope the management of Regal Kowloon Hotel can fix this false advertising issue as well as train staff better on customer service, especially when dealing with an issue that is the hotel’s fault.",1,"Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay.I am sorry to learn your unpleasant experiences and the room size was not up to your expectation during your stay.I have reviewed the case with concerned department heads in order to look for improvement accordingly.We look forward to having another chance to welcome you back again.RegardsChristo DiamandopoulosGeneral Manager","Responded March 22, 2021"

Wanted to check the differences between the rooms as the names of rooms on hotels.com and their website are different and quite confusing, so emailed the hotel directly and received prompt replies. Upon arrival, an upbeat friendly doorman greeted and helped with my suitcases. It was important for me to have late check-out as my flight was at 11pm, they have policy that guests can pay 50% of the daily room rate for guaranteed late check-out. My booking on hotels.com included guaranteed late check-out at 2pm (instead of normal 12 noon), paying 50% of the daily room rate for extra 4 hours didn't seem like a great deal. I was lucky enough to have manager Maven served me at reception, I asked him whether there are any other options. Basically for almost the same price as the 50% of the daily room rate, I had a room upgrade, with the addition of breakfasts at Playt, Lounge Access with afternoon tea and cocktail, plus guaranteed late check-out at 6pm, this was a far better deal so I went with that. I preferred harbour view which Maven tried to accommodate the best he could. When I got to the room, I thought there will be a bathtub but there was none, so I headed back down and he managed to find me a room basically with everything I had hoped for. There was renovation in the room below with external bamboo framework, he went to check that this didn't block the view before he gave me the room and also let me know about such. Have to say I was extremely impressed with Maven's professionalism, had stayed at quite a few places all over the world and it is not often that you feel that staff genuinely cares about guests and goes above and beyond but I definitely felt this with the services that Maven provided.The room I had was the Deluxe Executive Room, the room wasn't huge but with a nice bathtub and rain shower, comfortable bed. Everything very nice and new since the room was one of the recently renovated ones. My only complaint is the green chair was extremely uncomfortable to sit in. Breakfast at Playt and the afternoon tea on 26/F were alright, a little disappointed but not a big deal. Ordered room service one night, had the Wonton noodles, it came quickly and was lovely. Also went up to Skye during both day time and night time, the view overlooking Victoria Park, the harbour and Tin Hau is simply spectacular. Staff are friendly and helpful. I wanted to weigh my suitcases, one of the luggage staff came up to my room and helped weighed all my suitcases which was extremely helpful. I also needed 2 documents printed,  emailed them to the reception and they printed right away and even brought it to my room. Have to say all round top notch services provided by the staff. All in all, am very glad I chose to stay at Park Lane Hotel for my last 2 nights in HK, it was a comfortable and memorable stay. Certainly a hotel I will stay again when back in Hong Kong.",1,"Dear missvtravels,Thank you so much for taking the time to provide us with such great feedback!

However, I found that this property has decided to lower their standards (mainly in their breakfast offerings and Executive lounge).  The breakfast selection was extremely poor and limited and certainly much worse than any Novotel property in Hong Kong. It was bewildering to see such limited offerings in the restaurant, and no wonder there was seldom anybody having breakfast during my stay. Then, the club lounge benefits were also managed in a way that it was more an invitation for their premium guests not to use them. There were no buffet options for the evening cocktail, and you were supposed to have whatever they decided for you with limited options too, not to mention that the quality of wine was not up to the standard you may expect in a proper Pullman property.At least there were some positive notes, the staff I encounter were all great and trying to compensate for the obvious shortcomings the property has. And the room was fine too, except not well designed for business travelers since they cannot even have a proper working table.It was rather sad to see how this property is not only damaging his own name but the Pullman and Accor brand in the process. If they cannot offer even the basic standards, they should made clear in their website that during this time breakfast offerings are limited and the same applies for executive lounge benefits, so potential guests will not be misled. A place that cannot be recommended since there are much better options in Hong Kong currently with full buffet breakfast and proper executive lounge offerings at much lower room rates.",1,"Dear Prayanak,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts again especially since our Duty Manager had personally been in contact with you during your stay.

The housekeeping staff were polite and friendly and did a great job making up the room, always leaving it clean and fresh. The room was also soundproof from street noise, but occasionally, we could hear noise coming from outside the room door from people in the hallway. Our favourite thing about the hotel is its very convenient location. Close to the Causeway Bay MTR station and close to all of Causeway Bay's best shopping and dining options (Lee Garden, Sogo, Times Square, etc.). I did not dine at any of the hotel's restaurants, so I cannot comment on that, but I used the gym a few times.

Not only because I could benefit from the ALL membership, but also because of the homely experience I receive whenever I stay here.Checking in was hassle-free, with Gigi handling the whole process very smooth and professional. Originally booked for the Premium Deluxe Room, but Gigi kindly upgraded us to the newly refurbished Premium Pullman Room, which includes a spectacular view of the Victoria Harbour. Shortly after I entered the room, I received a personalized welcome card from the Loyalty Service Team and also a fruit flatter, which makes me feel very warm and elated. But when my companion arrived at the hotel and examined the room, he was a bit disappointed when the room does not include a bathtub. We therefore went to the front desk again and luckily we were able to receive another upgrade of our room from the reception, which allowed us to enjoy our stay in the very stylish Deluxe Executive Room.With the included dining credit from our package, we patronized the SKYE restaurant which is located on the top floor of the hotel. We were lucky to be seated at the window side, which allowed us to enjoy the spectacular night view of the Victoria Park during our mealtime. The quality of the food was superb. I especially enjoyed the signature cocktails and their beef wellington. However, the service of the restaurant has room for improvement, as the staff could hardly notice us while we want to take an order, even when my companions tried to make eye contacts with the staff, still no one intended to approach us, and I somehow find it rather rude to raise my hand to call the waiter over for any requests we are about to make every time.The buffet breakfast was sumptuous, with a wide range of selection of food such as cereals, salad and even dim sum and Chinese noodles. My companion and I enjoyed the breakfast very much, and I could proudly say that this is the best buffet breakfast offered among all other Accor hotels in Hong Kong.I was contented and very delighted with the overall experience I had this time on our stay at the Park Lane Hotel. Once again, many thanks to everyone who is working hard behind to help making our staycation a special and memorable one, especially to Ray from PLAYT, who kindly assisted us during our breakfast, and to Cindy from the Loyalty Service Team, who kindly assisted me for the check-out of my room. I had a great time having small talks with her, which made me felt like meeting an old friend of mine. In fact, I believe everyone at the Loyalty Service Team deserves kudos for their efforts of making my every stay at the Park Lane Hotel an enjoyable and memorable experience. Would definitely visit the hotel again in the near future :)",1,"Dear Mr Au,Thank you so much for sharing such an amazing review on TripAdvisor community!

From the front desk, executive lounge to the restaurant, your staff are not only professional & speak excellent english, they know what hospitality is and clearly they do have the passion in what they do, in making their guests feel welcomed and special. They deliver a very high standard of service to the guests and I feel very well taken care of during my stay. The highlight of my Staycation was definitely the 4-Course In-Room Dinner, it's AMAAAAAZING! Dinner was served in my room with the harbour view, on a nicely set up table, a bottle of red wine is complimentary for us to enjoy with our meal, the Baked Pastry Seafood Chowder, Salad & Lobster Appetiser, Beef Cheek with Red Wine Sauce, Cheese Baked Scallop with Black Truffle and Potatoes, and the Red Velvet Chocolate Mouse in Love Shape were very delicate. I spent a long time arranging them nicely for taking pictures since I was celebrating my anniversary with my partner, it was indeed an overwhelming moment. I enjoyed every moment dining in my room with my loved one. They even wrote a personalised card signed by the staff wishing us ""Happy Anniversary"". I am beyond impressed by the amount of efforts they put in to make my experience unforgettable!!! It's the little extra effort that has made Park Lane stand out from the crowd, leaving a good experience and memory that is going to last for a long time. I would like to mention a few names of your staff who deserve to be recognised by their professionalism and excellent service. Andy Chiu, the front desk manager who was checking us in when we arrived, he greeted us very well and it was such a perfect touch to start our staycation. Andy explained us very well and sold us an upgrade to a ""Harbour View"" room with the access to the executive lounge and arranged a late check out time for us to maximise our celebration at the hotel. He then escorted us to the lift and wished us a wonderful stay, moments after we got into our room, Andy called us to check with us if everything's alright and to inform us the lounge on the day was at the lobby and reminding us to not forget that we had our In-Room dinner at 1930. It's hard to believe we would receive such amount of attention and service. Roger, the service leader at the lounge who welcomed us well, showed us our seats and then walked us through the snacks and drinks menu. I have to say his service language is impressive, that's definitely a service you'll receive in a premium hotel. The afternoon tea snacks are delicious, small bites but very satisfying! The following day when we went to the executive lounge on the 26th floor, Roger remembered us and gave us a very warm welcome. Another 3 staff who worked that day, Hilary, Jack and Sandy were also true stars, they are very cheerful and professional, they ensure our glasses are always filled and checked with us from time to time if we need something else. All the names that I have mentioned are definitely the asset of the hotel, it's them who made me feel special and want to go back. Please give them recognition that they deserve, I hope to see them again in the future when I go back!

It looks like the situation in HK will not let me travel for a while and staycation is certainly my first choice, with my loyal support to the group, hope that at least the lounge will keep me interested and come back again.

Everything - the suite, the food, the omnipresent hospitality - was perfectly executed, and my family and I managed to create another wonderful “Hyatt holiday memory” despite being unable to do our usual year-end travels.We were very warmly welcomed to the hotel by Director of Rooms Kelvin and Front Office Manager Phyllis when we arrived, and were efficiently shuttled to the Regency Club for our check-in, where we were able to relax with a drink and some snacks, which put us in the right state of mind from the start. The suite was in an excellent condition and our family of four felt very much at home in the spacious, clean and well-designed accommodation. It was great to be able to wake up to the soothing sea-view, and continue to have this feast for the eyes while we enjoyed the breakfast at the Regency Club (yes you could very aptly call this a feast for the senses!). Compliments to the Regency Club team for always being calm, cheerful and accommodating despite a very full house, and special call-out to Steve for his steadfast steerage of the Club front desk at all hours of the day (well, it seemed like all hours of the day since I always see him there!).I also had the opportunity to finally meet Godfrey who had very helpfully sorted out our room reservations prior to our arrival, and was always diligently surveying the lobby, ready to smooth out any wrinkles if any appeared. I am a beneficiary of his expertise (as Guest Experience Manager) since we all had an outstanding experience during our short but sweet stay!The highlight of our stay has to be our dinners at Sha Tin 18. The food was excellent as usual - the restaurant’s specialities of Peking duck, roasted pork rice (prepared a la table - what a treat!) and Dongguan cuisine - were expertly cooked, but what stood out was Sebastian's (Assistant F&B Director) very personal hospitality. He made the pre-arrival arrangements (and very graciously accommodated my numerous request), curated the menu for us both nights that we were there to ensure that we had the best of the diverse menu, and discreetly checked in throughout our dinner despite the hectic full house (I was very impressed to see him and Benson (F&B Director) down in the trenches with the rest of the service staff throughout the dinner service!). Despite living in Hong Kong Island and having (more convenient) access to many great restaurants, it is the “extra mile” from Sebastian, Benson and the F&B team that will keep us coming back again and again (if we can secure a table at your very popular restaurant, that is!), Thank you once again for a really wonderful end to a very unusual and at times trying year … we are looking forward to our next visit when we can load up on the delectable delicacies at Sha Tin 18 before (or after) burning off the calories with an exhilarating bike ride right by your doorstep, and then having a restful night in an inviting suite. Wishing you and your team a great start to 2022 and a roaring entry into the Year of the Tiger!",1,"Dear AaronYeoThank you very much for taking the time to share your feelings and experience.

First, you get much faster check in in the lounge. Main check in at the hotel has BIG issues- long slow moving lines and no option for fast track online check in - you ask for it please let people use some kind of fast track self check in !I was waiting to meet a friend and that line did not move. Empty check in desks and the world of Hyatt desk  man was flicking through papers- when theres a line of 45 approx people looking fed up get them processed fast- offer then water, do something !Honestly ive seen thus at this hotel quite a few times. You have families just waiting like in an airport sitting on bags. - offer them water, coffee, chance to sit at the terrace area while waiting would all improve the often chaotic front area. Room lovely and quiet, it did smell slightly  damp but thats typical ond rooms not used as often in HK. All worked well in room. Bed extremely comfortable and slept really well both nights. Room service excellent- fast and efficient and food always good.Room is a bit old fashioned now- they do need renovated, people dont really use bif office desks anymore and the brown sofa was fine  but looks old style now. For 2 people to eat, theres only one chair and no small movable table. Needs some thought Lounge breakfast and light dinner have a good choice. Covid management good. Pool access was fine. Its a nice pool set up and if you love sun, great.  not too much shade. Sessions from 12-14 quieter as local families prefer less sun and later slot. I would personally try for an early check in at 130 and pool access even if youre room isnt ready. Dee at the pool is excellent- looked after everyone in a surprise thunder storm keeping us dry while he got wet. pool access was OK- at  Grand Hyatt in central Hk its awful right now- chaotic lines as pool totally over subscribed and pool access there is not guaranteed at all. We left really impressed with the lounge staff and the hotel in general. It does need room renovations but its good value. The club was a good choice.  You may have to be assertive with food as Cantonese families enjoy piling their plates high.We got a lovely handwritten card and anniversary gift from the lounge staff on our stay.

Debating between the Sheraton Tung Chung, the Auberge and the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin, we decided to go with the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin.I am not going to say there was no hesitation, taking into account the age of the property (over 10+ years) and negative reviews here on TA, where possibly 9 people would end up disappointed – but we took a leap of faith which I am thrilled to say was the best choice for us.Whilst the property does need a refresh/refurbishment, considering the rate being paid and the offering for the rate (we took 1x 2-bedroom suite, 2x Club rooms – one of which was subsequently upgraded to a Deluxe club – rates included club access and breakfast), we felt this was fair. The rooms are well appointed, clean, had great views regardless facing Tolo Harbour or the lush green mountains.The Club itself is by no means comparable to that of the Grand Club Lounge at the Grand Hyatt, but again, for the room rate being paid for is a fair offering. Evening cocktails provided a variety of food and drinks for all, however, for me, it was the homemade butter cookies that completed our days!The amazing pool, whilst sometimes crowded with staycationers as one would expect given summer holidays now, gave us the feeling of being away from Hong Kong. Pity that with the covid restrictions, F&B couldn’t be served at the poolside, it was still great for us.Breakfast provided both local and western options, adult and children friendly food. With Po taking care of our area, we had absolutely delightful and attentive service.Sha Tin 18 is a must go if you are at the hotel. Don’t miss out on the Peking duck which is done in the Beijing style – delicious and we had 2! Pro-tip: don’t stress if you are just 2 people, you can certainly order half a bird! But do ensure you are booking this restaurant before even your stay, it does get really full.Overall, I am glad we took the leap of faith and stayed here. Thank you to all the teams and wonderful people we met – from Riaan, Po and Benson to Kelvin, Eric and Wilson for making sure our stay was comfortable and fun.To end this review, this is the message I got from the child in the group “this is the best hotel I have stayed at, I had so much fun, I want to go again.”",1,"Dear NeeNee8888,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience.

Went to Hyatt Centric and Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui and I must say they are very hospitable no matter which Hyatt hotel you go to! I was very impressed with the efficiency of this hotel in particular, the queue arrangement of the swimming pool. Although I checked-in on a Wednesday, it was still busy at the hotel due to summer vacation. But they still manage to maintain great efficiency!Prior to checking in, I always wondered whether I would get the chance to swim and I actually did! They require you to go to the fitness centre 30 mins in advance prior to the next pool session to reserve your seat. Their arrangement was so quick and simple, I didn't have to wait to get the ticket nor wait to enter the pool. Very smooth indeed.The lunch buffet at the Cafe with my family was splendid! Lots of delicious choices! Staff there were really friendly too! Among the 3 Hyatt hotels I went to, I think this one was the best one. Last but not least, I really want to sincerely thank the Guest Experiences Team for treating my Dad a nice birthday treat, he had a nice, enjoyable stay at the hotel.  I really appreciate the effort especially the hand-written card. At first I thought it would just be a generic printed birthday wish card to actually find out it was hand-written. I really appreciate it! It's the thought the counts! Kuddos to Hera & Michelle from the Guest Experiences Team for preparing this. Though we did not meet, I genuinely appreciate the effort. Shout out to Matthew and Nicholas from the Front Desk for being really efficient and hospitable during check-in!   Just a comment on room cleanliness & condition, better pay attention to the sides of bed and crevices as there some hair & dust found when I entered the room. This felt short of my expectation as the other Hyatt hotels performed well in terms of cleanliness. Also, I think the management could consider replacing better curtains in the toilet as when you pull them down, it goes down in one go. I thought I broke the curtains. I'm used to the ones that go down slowly as you pull it down. Otherwise, everything else was excellent! I let it slide this time.",1,"Dear Japes,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience.

We eventually didn’t drink it and leave it in the room.  I will say there’s nothing to do around the hotel but cycling.

I truly appreciate that Shatin 18 offers delivery services during this challenging time. My old parents are reluctant of eating out, and Shatin 18 is one of my dad's go-tos. So, I thought this year would be nice if I order him (+ my mom) a small lunch for delivery so they can enjoy it at home for Father's day. The ordering process was fine until I realized I could not pay online. I called and was informed by the restaurant's manager that I would not be able to pay online? what?! That my parents would have to pay in CASH when they delivered to their lobby. That would be so lame since it was a gift from me. The reason being my credit card wouldn't be processed for 2 days, therefore I would not be able to place the same-day order. Strange! I use the same CC all around the world and had never heard of that. I insisted that I was not wire transferring and CC shouldn't have a delay. No information about ordering 2 days prior if paying by CC on the website either. After 4 phone calls later, I was finally able to just click a link and paid online, and it went right thru. My goodness, what a waste of time! Not only it is ridiculous to offer online food delivery and ask customers to pay by cash ($130US btw), the unnecessary hassle that I had to go through to just prepay the meal is just too much from a big international hotel chain. And come one we are in 2021 right?!2 issues obviously. 1) User experience issue from the web offering to check out. 2) Lack of staff training. They obviously don't know what they are talking about. Since it was apparent that there was a way to just pay online easily, why gave me the run around? (requiring 4 international phone calls) Mr. Wilson Lee, if you are reading this, I urge to you take some time to improve your web offering, check-out process, and provide proper staff training. I look forward to going back when soon enough. But in the meanwhile, I would like to give you feedback on this experience.",1,"Dear genkiippai,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience and it is our honor that you appreciate the food at Shatin 18.I am sincerely sorry that your takeaway experience did not meet the high standards we strive to deliver.

There is something about the Hyatt staff that makes the positive experience feel so genuine. Perhaps it’s the culture and training, but whatever it is, its consistency makes the brand stand out against the others.Our first stay was a five-day weekend, and the lobby was packed with a line you would typically see as Disney land. As a Hyatt member, I was able to check in fast, which was a huge help. The staff was highly professional and was able to handle the large crowd very well. I was thoroughly impressed. Throughout the whole stay, the team didn’t miss a beat with providing an excellent experience.2nd stay was a birthday celebration, and I wasn’t expecting anything but Godfrey, the guest experience manager, reached out to arrange a cake sent to our room. During check-in, the world of Hyatt desk saw that we had kids and combined our two rooms into an available 2br suite so we could have an earlier check-in. Not expected but greatly appreciated. 3rd stay,  we met Godfrey, and he recognized my name as we’ve exchanged a few emails from our previous visit. We had friends checking in the next day into a suite and were hoping to get an early check-in so the kids can hang out in the room. He managed my expectations that chances were slim given the high occupancy. However,  he surprised me with an upgraded room which solved our problem and made our stay more enjoyable. I’ve seen properties get overwhelmed with unexpected high occupancy, but this one definitely knows how to handle it without losing its commitment to providing an excellent guest experience.",1,"Dear hkam623,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience.

Received an email few days prior to my arrival to introduce the opening hours of hotels facilities and restaurants, as well as the reservation for the evening cocktail at the Regency Club. AFMO Lorraine Yiu did offer prompt responses to my emails but sadly cannot secure me a table at Shatin 18.The view from the room was quite nice, especially if you booked a Tolo habour view room or suite. The benefit of locating far away  from urban is its spacious rooms and suites.The maintenance and cleanness of rooms are unsatisfactory. It was hard to believe the hotel was only operated from around 10 years. Facilities were old and they had the oldest TV, that with a thick border frame, I had ever seen in a hotel. Grand Hyatt HK (I know it is not fair to GH to have them as a comparison), operates for over 30 years, has even better maintenance works than Hyatt Shatin.Service level was another great disappointment. I understand it is hard to constantly ensure a seamless service, so I make this review after a number of visits and believe it should be representative. In the perspective of  hotel policy, although it is not a luxury-oriented hotel, I still expect there would be something as small as a welcome card, that another Hyatt Regency in TST also did. There was also no turn down service. Nobody came to refill water and tidy up the room in the evening. But I think they would still willing to provide this service by request.Apart from the hotel policy, staffs did not compensate a lot for a better experience, but might even make it worse. Checking in on weekday, there was not many guests, but all courters were occupied. I stood in front of the front desk for 5 minutes with a lot of front office staffs walked by but all ignored me. I am not saying that they had to stop what they were doing, but a short greeting and telling me to wait would be warm enough.The staffs at Cafe Hyatt was a joke. Not to comment on its breakfast quality, what I can share is I indeed had a greater service at McDonald. Being ""warned"" several times as I entered the buffet area through their so-called ""exit"". I asked for the reason, but the staff could not explain and just said it was the rule. Ironically, she also entered through the ""exit"".To be fair, the swimming pool is quite impressive. One of the best outdoor swimming pools in Hong Kong, other than Four Seasons' and Grand Hyatt's.I expect there would be great improvements in several perspectives. Also be reminded that guests could really feel the service that is offered from the heart. At least there shall not be copy and paste responses to all reviews in Trip Advisor.",1,"Dear chunhosiu,Thank you very much for taking the time to leave a thorough review, I welcome all feedback as hearing from our customers is the best way we can improve our business.As much as we strive to deliver the best services to our guests, it is truly regrettable that we let you down during your stay with us.

The staff are always wonderful, and what some of the younger staff lack in experience and English language skills they make up for in enthusiasm and helpfulness. This staycation was for my annual birthday treat and I was thrilled to be given a complimentary upgrade. That said, there are a few minor issues they could consider addressing.In my room the TV was “getting on a bit.” The more modern hotels now have smart TVs and I missed having access to Netflix and YouTube. The hairdryer was attached low down in the bathroom with one of those curly cables and a button you have to keep pressed in. It wasn’t easy to use, and my thumb kept slipping off the button! I realise that theft is a problem, but they take our credit card numbers, so a discrete note to the effect that if you take it, you pay for it, and a suitable replacement charge would be better than the thumb-fight! I was looking forward to using the jacuzzi / sauna / steam, but they were all closed (Covid, I assume). I would still have stayed there, but this information should have been made available. Also, using the pool was a trial! I went down there, settled down with my book, and bang! cleared our for cleaning. I returned, settled again, and bang! my “session time” was over. All I wanted to do was sit by the pool and relax; sadly, that was not easy. Again, I understand that Covid has made things difficult, but a “pool timetable” in the room would have saved me a lot of bother. That said, once you do settle down, it’s hard to believe that you are in busy Hong Kong, and not on some tropical island. Bliss!The general condition of the hotel is good, and the hotel is always immaculate (even the dust trap on my hairdryer was clean – something I always check, after a friend had her hair set on fire!). But the public toilets are looking dingy, and don’t even have auto flush; the buttons on the lift are getting harder to see, wearing thin from the thousands of tapping fingers (It doesn’t help that these places are so dark, either), and the décor is beginning to look quite dated. I think it’s time for a bit of an upgrade. F&B – I ate in the café and ordered room service. The food was of a high standard and the service excellent. The café can be very noisy, though (wooden floors), so I recommend booking a corner table if you want to talk. ",1,"Dear GillianKew,Thanks for the review sharing your experience.

Front office staff were courteous, efficient and flexible in making my stay an enjoyable one. I particularly enjoyed receiving a personalised email before my arrival, to inform me that my 12 noon early check-in and 2pm check-out request were approved. It is great to know that the hotel gives flexibility to its guests given the low occupancy. Thanks to their early check-in approval, the hotel boosted its revenue as I decided to arrive early and have lunch at the hotel restaurant’s (which I wouldn’t have done if I had not been approved early check-in). Lunch buffet is good, quality of the ingredients is what you expect of a five star hotel. Waiters are efficient and attentive. Real napkins are provided, which is what expect of a five star hotel (some hotels give paper napkins which I hate!). The choice of desserts could be improved and table presentation could be better (you don’t have anything to put your plate on, it’s probably gonna damage the wooden table). Breakfast is equally good. Again, all what you would expect of an international five star hotel. One thing missing is the salmon. The hotel could consider adding at the breakfast buffet as other hotels do. In-room dining service is extremely efficient! Probably the fastest I’ve ever experienced. Quality once again is good, nice presentation. In-room dining menu is a bit confusing though. The main menu with all choices is within the guest book, the big menu displayed doesn’t show everything. I don’t know why they don’t just have a single menu. Rooms have no minibar but there is a 24/7 pastry shop open. Items are reasonably priced, especially taking into account that there is no alternative around. The apple tart is the hotel’s signature dessert, definitely try it! Cons are similar to the buffet, there aren’t enough desserts to chose from at the pastry shop except the usual muffins. Swimming pool is huge. Pool staff are helpful. A big plus: it’s a heated swimming pool, which I really enjoyed. They have to close it for 10 to 15 disinfection a few times within the day but it doesn’t take long so you can wait outside the pool area and come back once it’s done. Very high hygiene standards, towels all packed in plastic. The only disappointment with the pool is the cleanliness of the chairs. Many of them have stains; that’s the only thing I think needs to improve. Housekeeping is efficient as well, items requested through the operator come very fast. Wifi in the room is fast. There is an option to pay extra for wifi which I didn’t need to do, but I find it a bit outdated in 2021 to tell guests they should pay for faster wifi. Local calls are charged 6HK$ per call; most five star hotels offer local calls free of charge and the hotel should follow suit, there is no point charging local calls. The guest service centre operator is very efficient and promptly understood my request. However, what could improve with operators is personalisation. When requesting them to pick my room service tray, I would appreciate to get a more personal touch by being asked how my meal was, instead of just being told ""we are coming right away."" The operator could greet guests by their personal names and when receiving a wake-up call request, they could ask whether a second wake-up call is needed. Nespresso machine could be added in all rooms, that's what most hotels of this category tend to do.Overall, I was very satisfied staying at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin and will look forward to my next visit. Strongly recommended especially for people who wish to escape from the city’s stress.",1,"Dear r10835,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience.

The staff at Shatin 18 were all polite and provided excellent services.  The Regency Club offered excellent seaview and we enjoyed its evening cocktail session so much.  During the weekend, the hotel divided the cocktail session into three, allowing Globalist members / executive room guests to pre-book their preferrable session.  It is a very good policy as the Regency Club would not be overcrowded during its evening cocktail session.  I would like to give special credit to Helen from the Regency Club.  She was such a kind and professional club host.  Before my stay, we communicated through email and she explained everything in details.   When checking us in, she promptly pre-booked cocktail session and re-confirmed our booking at Shatin 18 for us.  She also helped arrange a birthday cake for my father's birthday.

Bedding was appalling, mattress is hard and unforgiving, pillows were similarly dreadful and the duvet was thin and barely functional. The staff tried their best to place an extra matress cover, but they had no real options for any aspect of the bedding, if there's one thing I expect the Hyatt Regency to get right it's the bedding. The tv was not able to connect to our devices so we could play our own videos as it's dated and not a 'smart' tv. The tv's channel guide wasn't working and the tv itself had all instructions in chinese with no options to change the language so it was impossible to format the tv to our needs in any case. No creamer in the room for teas and coffees, the aircon fan was too noisy despite turning it down and there are not enough hooks or rails in the bathroom to hang used towels and other items.The food was average without being exceptional at both the dinner and breakfast buffet, a poor burger patty at dinner and a breakfast buffet that was ok but the buffet was cold and not turned over much with the egg station only offering 3 fillings in the omelette (and they didn't ask me which three i wanted, or not). The cafe area was overly cold , we could feeling the cold air circulating down form the ceiling vents. on the plus side the staff were very helpful indeed and tried their absolute best to help with anything we mentioned , they were truly excellent and for that we would return, hopeful that some of these items are fixed.The location is great for exploring the region's excellent hiking, walking, cycling and water options, this hotel is a great base for outdoor options in this area.

It was the first international branded hotel opened in New Territories, and also an integrated teaching hotel. With its proximity close to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, overlooking Tolo Harbour and backed by Kau To Shan, it is very suitable for a resort hotel at this location, slightly far from the city but also close to the natural side. Tempting natural environment, quiet neighbourhood and international hotel, seem a good recipe for a perfect staycation, or is it?My reservation was the staycation package deal, with HKD880 dining credit included. I was planning to try the Peking Duck at Shatin 18, which is so famous and I have always wanted to try. However, to my disappointment, when I tried to call the restaurant to reserve one for mine, I was told that ducking was not served as a takeaway, neither did dim sum and some signature dishes as well. Maybe it was because of quality control or cost issue, but it was my first disappointment.I arrived in the afternoon on Friday, sun was shining through the glass door into the lobby. Natural light accompanies the earthy tone of the lobby provided a very relaxing welcome. Check in was smooth and nice, everything was really in no time, breakfast confirmed and paid upon check in as well.I was assigned a room on 12/F, overlooking the calm water of the harbour and rocky Ma On Shan, and CUHK Med school to my left, indeed the view was very good with nothing blocking my sight. The room was also spacious, especially the design of the bathroom was a surprise. Separate area for different purpose and dressing table, perfect for anyone who wanted to look good before going out for the day or night. There were signs showing the little history of the room, some scratches and marks, but I did not find it troubled me and the room was clean and well-appointed. I liked the soft lighting and balcony-style window of the room.I made some request through mobile application as quite a lot of amenities I needed were not in the room, before I went out for a run to the Science Park along the harbor. When I returned, I found out that things were not delivered probably, most of the items I requested was missing. I had to make a call to the operator and asked for them again. Maybe the person responsible for mobile services overlooked the details I typed? Not exactly a big deal though.For dinner, I have selected Shatin 18 anyway, even though they were not serving the duck. I stopped by Shatin 18 on 4/F after my run to ask for a menu of the restaurant, the lady outside was perhaps busying with some other commitments, just asked me to go online and search for their menu. Surprisingly, until this moment, there was no one telling me the arrangement and food options for dinner within the hotel, not at the front desk, not inside the room, was I supposed to dig out the details myself in order to make good use of the dining credits? After deciding the food that I wanted, I went back to level 4 to make the order, and only at that time, I was told by the busy lady standing outside the restaurant that I should have approached the café on level 1 to make the order. It was my mistake and I immediately apologized to the lady, but she still decided to take my order anyway, highly appreciated!Finally dinner was served and I believe it was unfair to judge the quality of a restaurant by its takeaway. The taste of the food may deteriorate as there were too much transportation between me and the kitchen. But I would say the BBQ pork was still very nice, good taste and texture. The chicken however, was not comparable with the pork, it tasted like frozen meat and did not really have a taste, a bit disappointed for that.The next morning, I was greeted by the sunshine through the window and also looking forward to my breakfast as well. Not sure if you have heard it, but some say the breakfast here has a great variety that worth coming just for the breakfast, even though you are not staying here. And sadly, the rumors did not hold, at all. Choices here were quite limited, and here are some examples. No fresh juice provided; 3 options for cheese; 2 options for cold cut; omelet ingredients: 3; no pancake station (served in a bulk in hot food section); no noodle station. Hot food (western) was limited to the basics, sausage, crispy bacon, egg, ham, hash brown, baked beans, and I think that was it. To be very honest, the breakfast did not have to be the same level as Grand Hyatt (it was unfair as price point were different), but it should not feel like a 3-4 star hotel?I have paid attention to the staff whom I have interacted throughout my stay, but I decided not to mention any of them here. While few of them has provided excellent and heart-warming services, many of them actually made a cold touch to guests. And the responsibility of my disappointment did not solely lay on their shoulders as well, it was not the front line who decided to reduce breakfast options, not the front line to decide not to serve Peking Duck as takeaway and not the front line to make such a confusion in hotel dining options. The management did bear part of the responsibility as well, and result in such a “not-that-glamourous” Hyatt resort of Hong Kong.The hotel has an excellent location and facilities as a resort hotel in Hong Kong, but with these standards and disappointment, I see no reason for locals to visit again sadly.",1,"Dear J S,Thank you for the review.I am sincerely sorry that your stay experience did not meet the high standards we strive to deliver.

The suite is very large (especially for Hong Kong standards) and suitable for long stays as it has a large bedroom with an en-suite bathroom equipped with a bathtub, and a living room with a half bath. The views of Tolo Harbour are great as well.We had access to the club lounge which during COVID times offered an evening cocktail from 4-6PM and breakfast between 6:30-10:30AM. The spreads for both were not too large but all of the food and drinks were quite tasty and the service was noticeably better at Regency Club.Using our credit from the Staycation Package we dined at Sha Tin 18. While the service wasn't much to speak about, the dim sum was tasty and had large portions. I appreciated that they split up the dim sum between two tables for our party of four. Note that while the hotel is just a minute away from University station, there are very limited takeaway options nearby.Overall I was really satisfied with the suite I got at Hyatt Regency Sha Tin, and hope to return soon when more facilities like the swimming pool and tennis courts open back up!",0,NaN,NaN

I immedately ordered one and I would likecto share my three cheers after trying it.  First cheer is the packaging.  The clay pot is strong enough to protect all those luxury ingredients (thick enough for slow cooking to avoid burning the ingredients in the bottom). The vegetable, crispy shrimps and fish skin crisps are kept in separate boxes to ensure their freshness and crispiness. Attention to details. Well done.  Second cheer is about the selection of ingredients. Crispy shrimps and fish skin crisps with salty egg yolks - yummy, trendy, and crispy. Kale is one of the assorted veggie.  Kale has a strong flavor and it enhances the flavor of the Poon choi sauce.   Making this Poon Choi very special. Third cheer is its instruction to reheat and its food factory licence to ensure safe cooking and eating.  Poon choi is seasonal food and many restaurants will overlook the cooking instruction and licensing.  Taking nothing for granted. Tony kitchen has paid special attention in food safety. All in all, this is not only a Poon Choi to Go. It is indeed a Poon Choi to Win.  2020 is winter to food businesses, but winter won’t last forever. I appreciate Tony effort to promote and his hotel and kitchen to go extra miles to create this beautiful Poon Choi.  Keep going and keep fighting.  Proud of your fighting spirit.  I already ordered two more to enjoy the early bird discount before  I wrote my experience.  Wishing you all good luck and good health in 2021.

They offered us an upgrade for a fee so we did as we arranged bikes from the hotel - these were incredible though, best bike and bike track!!In the room, considering COVID-19 is still here and vigorous, the suite wasn't cleaned. There were pret sticks in the bathroom and nuts on the floor. I went to use the body lotion and it was already used and sticky. (I have pictures for all these things!!!) We went to put the slippers on after the bath and the slippers were all dirty too - what on earth???? We proceeded to watch a movie and snuggle up and both TV's had white lines through them, so we couldn't watch the movies properly (AGAIN, pictures of everything I have mentioned). In the end, we went to sleep, but until 1am there were loud noises from a wedding party next door and what sounded like bangs from upstairs, dragging the sofa or whatnot! Our apartment is loud because of children, we did not need this at an expensive well- known hotel. We called to complain twice and someone did come each time, but the noises did not continue. Considering HK has a 2 person rule, especially in hotels, this was not the case, next door had a party going on. After our second complaint, we also received bangs on the wall to annoy us for already complaining. This is disgusting.The next day, the woman at reception didn't ask how our stay was, but we told her only about the noise and she said 'if you didn't want to be around a noisy wedding party, you should have written this in the special request' - this is rich, considering they ignored our anniversary and earl check-in special request.The facilities looked insane + the bikes were great (but all closed due to covid), there was nothing else that would ever make us return here.What a mental experience.

It has something of a ‘business hotel’ aesthetic but the rooms are fine and quite spacious.I do think the hotel could improve its systems. In particular:- the check in queue from around 2.30pm is the longest I have ever seen, snaking around the large lobby. Is this really something they can neither anticipate nor improve?- access to the swimming pool is on a ‘first come first served’ basis meaning that you have to physically wait in the non-air conditioned waiting area for your time slot. Wouldn’t a reservation system make more sense?- there is no express check out. I thought express check out was now common everywhere.",1,"Dear AlanJ2149, thank you for having stayed with us and we appreciate your constructive comments. During this current time with staycations despite our best efforts regrettably there are waiting lines at check-in and rest assured that we are working on solutions to improve this.

The best views from the hotel can only be described as decent. The breakfast at Cafe East was of a high quality. There are many good restaurants at the hotel and in its vincinity, but no in-room dining other than breakfast. It was relatively quiet during our stay and we managed to have the pool to ourselves at 11am on a Saturday.During check-in we were told that we needed to wait 1.5-2 hours for our deluxe ocean view room. We accepted the executive room upgrade on the 14th floor, only to realise it had no view. After complaining the first time, a second room on the 10th floor was arranged for us, but this was in fact a harbour view room that faced away from the Central skyline. The second complaint got us the third and actual ocean view room on the seventh floor.Maybe I was demanding, difficult to please or did not have to opportunity to clarify that my preference was for a room with the best view. Maybe the staff was doing their best so I did not have to wait at check-in, got a room upgrade or a high floor room. I must commend the staff for at least trying to rectify the issues, but they seem to miss the point in figuring out the priorities of the guests. I hope my complaints didn't get anyone in trouble and that was not my intention.It was a run-of-the-mill experience of a business hotel with an OK location and value, but good restaurants. I suggest guests beware, if you reserved the ocean view room, get what you paid for.",1,"Dear snowl933, thank you for choosing to stay with us and we regret the inconveniences which you experienced in order to getthe right room.

When I asked how late that I could request to put the additional Roll up Bed (as I  wish to have it after midnight). The response was as I wish, their service is around the clock. It was always a pleasure for them to serve us. House Keeping could fulfill our numerous requests by taking only 5 – 10 minutes every time (over an hour in others).Last but not least, Food actually was the main focus of the trip. Starting with an in room High Tea Tower, followed by a Delicious and Authentic Japanese set dinner. Breakfast Buffet offered ranges of Chinese, English and even Japanese Cuisine.

Although it was Sunday, the queue for check-in was so long! I had not seen such scene in this hotel before, although I stayed in this hotel several times already!  This showed that they must have listened to my advice and added the attractive packages!The minute we walked in the Residence Club Harbour View Room, I was dazzled by the “Happy Birthday” balloon decorations on the window pane with glittering Victoria Harbour at the background and the azure blue sky and balloons in bed!  My friend was also overjoyed by the efforts Miss Kwong made! It was so sweet of Guest Relations to write a birthday card to us! The excitement was not finished when a birthday cake was delivered to our room by the Hotel!They offered a choice of 2 soft pillows and 1 memory pillow.  One minor hiccup was that I got a stiff neck sleeping on a memory pillow! But it was readily put right by changing it to a foam pillow!The next day, we had the scrumptious lunch buffet with a variety of food to choose at Café East!  We also took the opportunity to share the joy and show our gratitude with one of our best friends by inviting her to join us at Café East.  The “buy-2-get-1-free” package was such a value-for-money treat that we did not miss!On the final day, it was good that we could have late check-out at 3pm.

And this is how I meet Grace & Bowie upon check-in. The check-in was very quick and informative, great work! Since my partner is actually a vegetarian, so during the evening cocktail session, there's no vegetarian option, but they could still do one step ahead to provide us french fries. That's very heartwarming and considerate, we can't thank you enough. And when we returned back into the room, there's a hand-written card, a bottle of red wine, and some chocolate arranged by Juliette & Natalie. Again, that's really a very nice gesture for our celebration. At around nighttime, I was drawing myself a bath in the bathtub, however, there's some stain on the waterline of the tub that I have to clean myself. The stain cannot be seen, it's something that you could feel by hand, once used the towel and some soap to wipe it, it will be good as new. This is not a complaint, maybe the housekeeping attendant missed the spot or didn't use the scouring pad to clean the tub, and I didn't mention it during the time because I simply don't want to cause too much trouble. And also please be expected there will be a little bit of mold around the standing shower, I know it's difficult to clean it so it's understandable.

Overall the experience was ok but a few improvements can be made.The check in was smooth and the lobby is bright and clean. The welcome staff was kind and attentive, offered to put my baggage at the counter while waiting for check in. Edmund who checked me in was attentive and friendly, he explained the details of the package to me. However he told me that we are only allowed to use the club for an hour during the cocktail session (supposedly to have free flow cocktail from 5-8pm) and you can queue again if you want to enjoy more. What a ridiculous arrangement, you should consider to expand your lounge if it is not enough to fit in the guests that you sell the package to. Moreover I’m unhappy that they did not inform us in advance. They can simply drop us an email telling us how they would cope with the people flow so I can also plan ahead. Changing something in our package without informing us in advance but only until the time of check in is totally unsatisfactory. We fortunately got an upgrade to a corner city view room. The room is spacious but the view is blocked by Fire Department Building. The washroom comes with bathtub and separate shower room, and it has washlet, which is very Japanese style. Our room has coffee machine but my friend’s didn’t have (which is also a city view room). Natalie from their guest relationship, and whom I talked to through phone before my stay is extremely polite and kind. She also wrote me a welcome note in the room which is heart-warming. The gym facilities are quite new. It is not big but enough for a quick workout. The pool arrangement is the worst among all the hotels I visited. You need to physically be there to queue and they only allow 10 people to enter per section (1 hour). You need to be there 40 minutes in advance, there were a few groups of guests reached 30 mins in advance but the pool staff told them it is already full for the next section. This was not what Edmund told me. Edmund told me I just need to be there half an hour in advance to make a RESERVATION (my understanding is that we will be on the list). I told the pool staff what I was told and the staff simply said Edmund was wrong, the staff was reluctant to communicate with Edmund despite my multiple requests. Personally I find the staff was rude and impatient, I was talking English to him and when my friend approached, he directed the conversation to my friend in Cantonese, and don’t bother to talk to me anymore. I was the one talking to him and he just felt convenient for him to talk to Cantonese so he stopped communicating to me. I felt disappointed and he was being disrespectful.Edmund did come to apologise after the incident. He was very polite and explained to me the miscommunication, he did make appropriate arrangement for me to get into the pool but we still queued for half an hour for the fairness of other guests.The pool isn’t big but have many sunbathing beds. The wooden floor is dirty. The pool is old and need serious cleaning.At the time of cocktail session, we queued more than 30 minutes to get a seat. I understand the hotel might be busy during the weekend , but what amused me is that the Residence Bar & Lounge is not only a club lounge for hotel guests but also a bar that open to public! It is funny that they managed to arrange a table for outside guests (which they paid), and as an in-house guest we are asked to queue and wait. If you want to earn more money by making your lounge a bar, then don’t sell any package that includes a lounge access. Or why don’t you just call it bar access? So I won’t expect it is a lounge that exclusive for your hotel guests. This also losses the exclusivity that a club lounge shall offer.We did get our table around 5.45pm and they didn’t chase us out after an hour as there is no queue. Personally I think the lounge is well decorated but it is extremely noisy with kids running around and it just looked like Cha Can Ting to me. Breakfast at Cafe East was above the standard. The restaurant has great natural light and the food is delicious. I like their Soya Milk and You Tiao! The female staff with tattoo at noddles bar is rude and impatient. Just to stress, i need to describe her with her appearance because all staffs do not wear nametag, make me hard to identify them.We did enjoy late check out at 3pm as provided under our package. Most of the above are not their staffs' fault. The management could be better. ",1,"Dear Danny Eu, many thanks for staying with us recently and we welcome your constructive review as it allows to further enhance shortcomings and to ensure corrective action.

This property was rebranded and given a massive make-up late last year. It now has an almost southwest feel to it with orange earth tone colours, desert furniture and cacti placed throughout the property. It is a nice look and feel compared to so many of the sterile and drab midrange hotel setups around the city. Reservation was made through booking.com where we found the best rates online. Confirmation was received immediately, check-in went smoothly and timely and we were up to our room in just a few minutes. Lobby area on the 4th floor beyond check-in desk is decorative and relaxing. They have a coffee bar, plenty of small tables, window side seating, a long table with a few games, large screen television as well as a small outdoor seating area. There is also a gym as well as a small outdoor area with a doggie pool. We stayed in one of Figo's Premium Suites, which was a neat little setup. Nothing fancy or upscale. Instead, think cute, quaint with perhaps a bit of a college apartment feel to it. The suite included a small bedroom with desk, closet, a bit of room for luggage, flatscreen TV and a generally comfortable bed. There was also a studio style living room with minimal kitchenette setup including basic cutlery, glasses, bowls, fridge, kettle and espresso machine. You could do some very basic food prep here but not any real cooking. There was a tiny two seater table fixed to the wall, small round coffee table and two seater sofa. To be fair, the sofa cushions were in bad shape, we both found ourselves sinking inward to the middle, meaning only one person could sit properly and it was still not very comfortable. This should be mended for the benefit of future guests. Room included a second flatscreen TV. There were enough electrical outlets, good lighting modes, working A/C, wifi and room safe. Tiny bathroom which separated the living room from the bedroom another clever configuration but might be a tight fit for larger guests. In the end, we felt that suite is a good option for a longer stay option providing more space for guests. The limited kitchenette means that you should expect to dine out or do delivery mostly which is perfectly fine as the Sheung Wan and Sai Ying Pun districts are loaded with quality restaurants, coffee shops and bars. Otherwise, it was a fun stay at Figo, one we'd be happy to do again with future staycations around the city.",0,NaN,NaN

It takes more than two months to secure a a room like this.  Also, it can only be booked by email with non-cancellation and non-changeable terms. So, make your planning carefully if you want to book themed room like this.This is our first time here, we spent our morning in Ting Kau Beach and evening in Lido Beach. The two beaches are located on the left and right of the hotel, both of which are just 3-minute walking distance away, which is very convenient.There is a shuttle bus travelling between the hotel and Tsuen Wan Station every 10-15 minutes and 2 kilometers+ of walking path down to Sham Tseng. The transportation here is considered as convenient. Those who do not like to dine in the hotel can travel to Tsuen Wan easily.There is even a small shop just beside the lobby. With  alcoholic drinks, cakes, and stuff you need for your staycation... If you are lazy to go out, the price is still reasonable here and there are even two vending machines here.It's not your regular 5-star hotel but The maintenance of the hotel itself is still OK. However, the breakfast can be skipped if you are craving for a full breakfast.Verdict: This hotel is really suitable for couples, spending their day on the beach and the hotel is just a 3-minute walking distance away. The cost? It's asking a merely 350HKD+10% on weekends. For a family? Well, 2 rooms can do, the beaches are good for families too.#lidobeach #tingkaubeach #RoyalViewHotel #hongkong #racingcar #sunset #sunsetphotography",1,"Dear Kenye55Thank you for sharing your impressions with us following your recent stay at Royal View Hotel.

The view was stunning so originally we were very satisfied. Our young toddler and infant needed an afternoon nap. And once I opened the blanket I felt some sand. We did not even go to the beach before entering the hotel room. Given I am not particularly picky, I thought a few wouldn’t hurt. But there was just too much sand filled with the entire bed. Obviously the housekeeping person didn’t change the bedsheet and didn’t even bother checking before letting guests check in. It’s really unacceptable given the room rate of hkd2k+ but such undesirable hygiene standard especially as a supposedly family-friendly hotel. We consider hotel management should tackle the issue especially on busy weekends to step up internal control over housekeeping to ensure basic hygiene standard is maintained.張床單上邊⋯⋯沙！全部都係沙！2021年12月4號星期六入住501號房，間房望出去風景好靚，本來係滿意嘅。check in 後諗住俾小朋友瞓一陣晏覺，點知掀開張被，摸到床單上面D沙，我份人不嬲唔挑剔，諗住撥走啲沙就算啦，點知係撥唔晒嘅，因為太多，成床都係！好明顯housekeeping 冇換到上位客人嘅床單。唯有打去前台，叫人即刻換床單被單。房價二千幾蚊，換嚟咁樣嘅衛生，講真，好難接受。希望管理層正視問題，尤其週末full booking時，安排足夠人手清潔房間。",0,NaN,NaN

I booked the hotel and informed that I have a 3 year-old child.  I can't find any toilet seats when I arrived the room.  When I ask for a toilet seat for my child, a housekeeping staff told me it has to be checked.  A while later, she told me there were no toilet seats available and brought me a small potty.  I told her the potty was too small that my child can't fit in.  She said she have to double check again to see if there were any toilet seats for me.  She told me she confirmed that all toilet seats were occupied and couldn't render any more assistance.  I was so disappointed.  How come a hotel was unable to provide a toilet seat even I guest told them there would be a child to use their room?  That is very unprofessional and not caring.  I tried to call their hotline and a friendly staff told me she will handle it for me.  Within 10 mins, a housekeeping staff brought me a toilet seat and explained it was so lucky that there was a guest finished using it [at around 15:30hrs] If it is so, I think the hotel need some budget to buy toilet seats in the coming year.Secondly, as the hotel restaurant was fully booked, I tried to order room service by calling the F&B at my room.  I tried 3 times.  No body answered and no body replied my calls.  The buffet arrangement is not flexible.  As my child was suddenly not feeling well, I tried to change the night buffet for 2 persons to a room service but the hotline staff told me that the hotel did not have this option.  Is this something so difficult to arrange some food to the guests who need to take care of their kids?  For people thinking of staycation there, need to think again.  By the way, the hotel is located in a remoted area and it's interesting that the shuttle bus service is very limited [only on Saturdays/Sundays/PH and 5 time slots only]However, the hotline staff is nice and friendly.

The hotel doesn’t have shuttle during weekday so the transportation caused us a trouble, it took nearly 2 hours for us to reach there. The bus from Sunny Bay is every half an hour so you are advised to schedule your time accordingly. Another option is to take ferry from Central.The check in was smooth at 2pm but we were asked to come back to get our key at 3pm. Our room is featured with an incredible harbour view and it is spacious. The bathroom has a sunken bathtub which looks like a Japanese onsen. The room’s design is simple and a little bit old but the view and bathroom made it up.The swimming pool is pretty. Each session is 1-1.5 hours and we didn’t queue to get in. The pool is quite deep so the kids are playing at a side pool and allows adults to have a good swim. The play room and gym are simple but enough for you to kill time.Their breakfast arrangement is good. The restaurant is spacious so you don’t have to worry about the seats. You can reserve your time slot at the restaurant and they provide breakfast until 12pm, so you can enjoy your breakfast and plan your day ahead without hassle. The food quality and variety is average.The service is standard. They charge 22hkd for each water bottle which I think is ridiculous. They do not have water fountain in the hotel as well so you have to purchase your own drinking water outside.

No apology. The hotel lobby was absolutely packed at that time. If a hotel knows how many guests they’ll have they need to have the staff to cater for this number of people. For key pick up I waited in the line I was told to by a member of staff and then about 15 minutes later got told I was in the wrong line and had to start again.We immediately cancelled our dinner reservation seeing the crowds in the lobby which, after experiencing breakfast, was a smart move.Kids club is nice enough for smaller kids though again over capacity. There was no member of staff though and the colouring station had no unused colouring sheets etc and noone to ask.The pool is on a one hour booking system and again was absolutely packed with seemingly no lifeguard service and no towels available for the first 30 minutes of our time slot. No apology. Certainly no sun loungers available.We went out for dinner and I asked for my towels to be refreshed while they made up the kids bed. Came back to find no fresh towels and a wet one that had been on the floor folded back on the hanger!Next morning got into the shower and discovered there was no shampoo or shower gel (it’s a refill system and had not been filled for our arrival). No apology. The food at breakfast was fine. Not an amazing variety but all ok. However, we were so crammed in I couldn’t get out of my seat without disturbing other diners and vice versa. Also coffee comes from a vending machine. I asked for a decaf coffee instead and was told not possible. I offered to pay for a decaf coffee but again not possible “because it was breakfast”. No apology.Housekeeping was very thorough the next day. They really did a good job.Check out was again a massive wait the following day.I am not sure what covid rules are in hotels but I’ve never seen such crowds.

They have been very good experiences, similar to what we have found during past stays at this property in Sheung Wan. This is a modern property with smartly-arranged and spacious suites in a very good location on HK Island. We have found best prices for booking directly on the 99 Bonham website. Email confirmations arrive instantly and we are always well received and given timely check-in upon arrival. Payments are taken upon arrival and they offer luggage storage if needed. A special note for the property staff, they are professional, courteous and service-minded, easily amongst the best team we have encountered while staying in hotels around the city in recent years. Location of the 99 Bonham is outstanding if you want to be near very good dining, bars and coffee shops. The property is 2 minute walk to the Sheung Wan MTR Station as well. Lobby area on the ground floor is small but sufficient, there is a 1st floor gym, washing and drying machines on quite a few floors available for free use and an rooftop on the 37th floor with remarkable views of the area, Victoria Peak as well as the parts of Victoria Harbour to the north. Importantly, the suites at 99 Bonham are very comfortable. The photos of the suites on their website are accurate and reflect what you can expect to find at the property. There are three suite types with minor differences in layout and floor space. Suites come with small kitchenette area, large bathroom, plenty of storage space, flat-screen TVs, glass dining table and seating for four people, good lighting, A/C, steady wifi and floor to ceiling glass windows allowing you to enjoy the views of the area skyscrapers from your own room. Importantly, beds are comfortable, allowing quality rest. They are very good suites and a nice place to come home to in the evening after long days at wook.We remain very pleased with 99 Bonham. They always do a nice job and leave us eager to return for future stays with them.

The Hilton Garden Inn was hidden far away from the main road, but also reachable to the metro. Even if the area wasn’t the most beautiful, the hotel itself was very nice and modern. The reception was quite narrow with some sitting foyer. The check-in was pretty quick. They took our temperature as well. Our room was at the 19th floor, facing the main road. You couldn’t hear any noise and the view of the city was stunning. The room itself was quite small but this was only our European cultural reaction. We did struggle a bit to walk around our suitcases. The room was very clean and cosy. We didn’t plan to stay in the hotel that much anyway. The bed was comfortable, temperature in the room adequate. There was also a small window bench which made a great relaxation area to enjoy a drink and the view. Bathroom shower was clean and always tidy. There was also a tv and a kettle with coffee/tea sachets. It was a shame that the pool was closed that time. Breakfast was served in their large restaurant. There was a lot options from traditional Asian food to continental, fruit and beverages.

Benefit cuts with price surgeI was told that the free parking has been cancelled one day before arrival when I make further enquiry with reservation hotline. I was told that fast pass has been cut for hotel guest since 1 July at Front Desk Counter upon check-in. Although they waive such charges during the stay, hotel should consider its inferior transportation. It is a wrong decision to cut free parking.2.	No clean and proper changing room at poolUnder this packed season, all swimming pool session was full and we have been allotted to use the pool at 12:00 next day after check-out. As we have checked out, we are told to use a public unclean toilet to clean our clothes with kids. And, there is merely one shower cubical for users. Finally, we need to change our clothes in public toilet and wait 10 minutes under air-conditioning environment for shower. I need to walk with my bare foot through the garden. The locker is outdoor and extremely tiny. I used 4 lockers to pack my things. When I ask for help from a male pool staff, he asked me to put my belonging on the bench but watch out myself.3.	No smiles / happiness from hotel staffsI can meet smile at the shop. I can feel most staffs are not happy at work and intense.

Finding the Best Deal? I had booked this 2 night (Tue - Thur) staycation months in advance to get a really good deal. I compared between Disney's own website between Hotels.com and ended up going with Hotels.com for a slightly cheaper rate. The hotel was extremely good in following all the remarks in the booking - 1.) my kids + husband's birthdays all fall in July, 2.) bed guards for both beds.Milking your Annual PassIt's great if you have a premium pass (or even if only ONE person in your family has it) you get all sorts of extra benefits. We had a 25% discount off for dinner and was given a free cake because it was the card holder's birthday. >> mind you we did have to make a reservation in advance and also ask for the hotel to put my kids' names on the cake. The hotel was awesome in all these extra touches like a small little chiffon cake for each kid when we got into our rooms, and then towers in the shape of cakes as turn down service. Checking In We arrived around 2pm and the lobby area was packed! They had a pretty good system of having you register your mobile number and then texting you when it's your turn to go check in. We waited for about 45 min before getting texted and once we got to the reception it was very brisk and smooth. There's plenty to see and do to kill time even around the lobby area (Disney store, TV corner for kids, lots of fun decorations, characters appearing every now and then, staff handing out stickers,  checking out Charts Cafe's snacks, etc.) It was pouring on the day of our check in otherwise I think you can venture straight into the gardens which are absolutely stunning! SwimmingA lot of reviews said booking for swimming timeslot was a pain. I agree and think if it was a one night stay we probably wouldn't have stood a chance. So we were grateful to be given a 10am timeslot for the third day and eventually still able to change it to 8am. Food Options  Mind you we did not book restaurants until the weekend before and almost everything was booked out. We only managed to get breakfasts confirmed (both days at the same restaurant), and on waiting list for dinner. They eventually called us back to confirm a table for dinner @ Dragon Wind for the first night and that was good enough. Tbh the restaurant was not even half full when we left the restaurant at 7:20pm so it IS possible. My recommendation is to only try each restaurant once. If you've got young kids, bring a LOT of snacks, fresh fruits and veggie sticks.Nemo PlayroomI had read a lot of reviews beforehand talking about when to line up... but to be honest, the line on non-park opening days are crazy long, so the best way to get in is to have an early dinner as soon as restaurants open at 6pm and get the kids in there for 15-20 min after meal time. To be honest, the playroom is pretty dry and anything less than 30 min is good enough - and only if it's a rainy day as well otherwise why waste time indoors!  All in all, I think if you lower your expectations, you definitely won't be disappointed hahaha The proximity of the hotel to Disneyland and being able to visit the park in the morning then head back for a short nap before running back for their last show of the day was all worth it!",1,"Dear Phebe L,Thank you for choosing our Lodge to be your staycation destination.

This was done on the Disneyland website. However when I checked in I was told that the 2 day park ticket was for the 2 adults only, despite the room booking being for 2 adults and 1 child. The front desk agreed that the original sale was ""misleading"". I was forced to pay for the child 2 day ticket making the price for my staycation way more expensive than budgeted. I hate to use the word ""scam"" but when booking a deal for 3 people and then being told that only 2 adults can go to the park, what am I expected to do with my child.

The staff are very friendly here. Especially the front door staff. They even helped drive us over to the other hotel to enjoy other restaurants. Room - overlooked the swimming pool. Nice size and clean. Comfortable beds safe for toddlers. I found there are too many people here for the hotel to cater for. I understand there are rules and regulations put in place due to covid but we couldn't book in any restaraunt and was told we can go and wait at a restaurant but there are 39 tables waiting for a table befor us. We did manage to get in to restaurant but we were told we had a time limit which I completly understand but the food arrived cold and just before our limit was up. We managed to book the swimming pool which is in 50 mins intervals so you get around 40mins in the pool once the staff check you in and they ask you to get out 5 mins before the 50 mins is up. Which is fine for me it was reassuring to know we are able to have a swim in the pool because I recon if there was no booking system we wouldn't be able to get near the pool for a swim (pre/post pandemic). Room service - it took around 30 mins for 2 drinks to be delivered to our room. Couldn't find anywhere to buy snacks or drinks without the need to call room service and waiting 30 mins for it. It wasn't until the next day I found in order to find the  the room service menu was through a QR code on the key or on the TV.Indoor play area. We tried 3 times for my son to go in and play.

;) ...disney characters are still around, eg we got to say goodbye to Mickey as he waved from the balcony just above the lobby, still being able to have that 'character greeting' picture with guests, in this social-distancing world we live in......although we still have to stay in the ever popular ADVENTURER'S SUITE (maybe one day someday when its actually available when we are), everything else is more or less the same, still fun for the kids & adults, from when were there last, especially the big sized rooms, large comfy beds, the rainshower....and of course the Lodge's castmembers, starting from the staff looking like safari guides at the entrance, and the housekeeping staff (in their uniform that always reminds me of Belle's blue & white outfit)...everybody always has a smile &or friendly greeting no matter what time the day....as such, its my pleasure to give a the usual shout out to those who assisted+took care of us during 3D2N, ie those who are basically the same 'friends' we've met/interacted with in previous visits...if you're lucky to meet them, be rest assured that you are in good hands of caring staff who genuinely provide excellent customer service:"" Thank you, Karl & Ivy (reception) , Yan and Raymond (DW), Neville, Ivy and Mike (WOC), Calli/Brianna (Gst Services), KC in the lobby, housekeeping/security staff we met during our stay""  ...and last but not least, thanks to the man in charge...the man with the silver fox looking pompadour, the man in his cool vest looking like he's just about to give the best ballroom dancing performance you've ever seen (just kidding, JF..haha)...seriously, ""THANK YOU very much JOE FUNG"" for possibly going above and beyond duties to ensure me & family really enjoyed but relaxed through last weekend...you're a good man with a great team behind supporting you..Disney is fortunate to have you boys & girls..good job y'all!....and ""Mr Moriarty, BRAVO!!""",1,"Dear JoseAN1167,Thank you for your stay at our Lodge and much appreciated for your valuable time to provide a detailed review of your stay with us.It is always thrilled to receive positive comments from our honorable guests regarding their enjoyable stay.

From the moment we arrived, we immediately knew we were in good hands of the team there.  Karl was such an amazing host and showed us the way to our suite, he was very interactive with the children, and also explained the design and features of the suite in great detail.  The suite itself was exceptionally spacious and the decorations were well thought out, and with a lot of hidden surprises for the little ones.  Our package came with in room breakfast as well so it allowed us to slightly sleep in the following day, food was neatly presented and very tasteful!  Our little ones received Mickey Dolls as souvenirs which we truly appreciated!  The suite itself was equipped with premium amenities (tent, Monopoly, an extensive list of DVD's) and entertainment games.  Additional perks included the Disney themed Jeep which brought us directly to/from the amusement park (unlimited trips), and canapés and snacks in our suite.  Moreover, a kid's corner (playroom) was also available beside the restaurant and we took advantage of this after our dinner, the kids had a whole lot of fun before heading to bed.During our stay, we were also warmly greeted by Joe, the Front Office Manager and he was very hospitable and genuine, and despite his busy schedule, we appreciate him taking his time to meet us.All in all, we were truly amazed with our experience and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who intend to visit the park and with a less tense schedule with an one night stay (Highly recommend family and friends to directly reserve for the Adventurous Suite and even the connecting room if traveling with a larger number of guests).  Thanks for the team's hospitality in particular, Joe and Karl who really look after us, we will be back!",1,"Dear FT0122,Thank you for your recent stay at our Lodge and contributed your valuable time to provide a thorough review about your staying experience in our Adventurous Suite, much appreciated.We are thrilled to receive your remarkable comments, thank you!

It is adventure-themed. Ocean scent air freshener is used and it smells good. It is well-garnished with chandeliers and many other decorations. During check-in, the staff is very friendly and patient. There are also staff roaming around and proactively offering help to visitors. The toilet in the lobby is very clean. The only thing that I would nitpick about is the size of the lobby and that of the gift shop within it. The gift shop offers fewer items than the gift shops within the Disney park. Although the lobby is bright and spacious, it could be even bigger in my opinion. The room we got is on the top floor (8th) and has two beds. Despite a lack of sea view (instead, it has a view of a certain part of the hotel, a garden and a parking lot), it is still totally fine because of the interior of the hotel room. There is a large wardrobe at the end of the entrance, and on the right is an open sink without a door. Next to the sink is a toilet and a shower enclosed behind a door. If you think having an open sink next to your bed (with a wooden barrier in between) is unbearable, then perhaps this hotel is not for you (not sure about other types of rooms, please do your own research). All of these amenities are neat and tidy. The cleaning products (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) are not in tiny bottles but are in reused bottles fixed within a metal rack inside the shower. Slippers and two bottles of water are gifted. There is also some kind of gifts on the table between the two beds. There are 3-4 power sockets within the room. The television screen is wide and long. Similar to the lobby, the room is also adventure-themed. Overall, the room is up to my standards, and Disney has done a great job.The greatest thing about this hotel is actually the outdoors. The landscape design across the gardens surrounding the hotel is done very well, compared to ordinary premises. Different types of flowers and trees are planted everywhere. At the heart of the hotel is a swimming pool hidden well by foliage. Due to safety measures imposed during the pandemic, the pool only allows 60 people for now. Around the pool is many more trees and bushes and also some boulders. The boulders create a pond, a waterfall and so much more scenery. The greatest thing of all is the part of the garden near the ocean.  It has a breathtaking sea view (although fenced off by the hotel boundaries) and perfectly manicured grass lawns. The lawns have some knolls, which make them even better and more natural. Lounging there under the sun is a very pleasant and memorable experience (especially if you are acclimatized to living in a city and seldom experience nature). Not sure if this is right, but you may ask for scooters to be ridden on the garden paths, and badminton rackets or footballs to be played on the lawns. This is what really qualifies this hotel as a part of the Disneyland ""Resort"". This hotel is really good for families and kids. There are many kids running around the lobby. The hotel is really great overall.",1,"Dear KaiHoM,Thank you for your recent stay at our Lodge and contributed your valuable time to provide a thorough review regarding your staying experience.We are glad to hear of your pleasant stay at our property enjoying our Cast Members's hospitality and the Lodge's facilities.

Went down and told Jobe about the problem , and without any explanation or apologies etc he  only asked “are you packed?” . (Implying he will change the room) , definitely not a language barrier since I spoke Cantonese . Anyways he did solve the problem and changed my room which was great, but his attitude wasn’t , compared to the morning reception staff . Been here many times and everytime the day time staff were excellent , friendly and courteous :)Anyways that’s the only thing I didn’t like.Pros : good price , spacious room , location near the tst east station , and walkable to other tst areas .This area is less busy and for me more comfortable .

Given the long weekend, it was hectic to be sure, but they kept a smile on while professionally and efficiently arranging rooms for customers. It was, as always, a delight to receive a warm greeting from Jobe. Of course in his absence during previous weeks, his colleagues, notably Kay, always made my stay pleasant.As someone whose lifestyle requires that I stay frequently in Tsim Sha Tsui, I can say, after staying at over 15 hotels in the area, that not all receptions are the same and it does make a difference.The rooms are comparatively bigger at Regal Kowloon so that's a huge plus, but what makes this my hotel of choice is the reception. 1) They think out of the box to meet my needs, suggesting a small additional amount so I could check out later in the afternoon. 2) They offer a personal touch; courtesy aside, you feel that you matter to them. Upon recognising me from previous visits, Helen (if memory serves) suggested that I become a member to get better deals. 3) They show initiative, asking me if I need someone to wake / collect me from my room.Thanks again to Jobe and team for another lovely stay. I saw him almost every time I passed the lobby during my 4-day stay, and I am amazed at his (positive!) energy. It must have been a draining weekend for them, but they made sure ours would be relaxing. That's hospitality!",1,"Dear GuestThank you for your review, it is truly appreciated.

Manager Dennis came and accused us of damaging it, said we needed to pay $2,000 fine otherwise the hotel will call the police. He said we reported this 3 hours after we checked in. I don't know what he thinks but please tell me which guest ever checks in and inspects every furniture and room condition to see if anything is damaged. He was out of line, unprofessional and was not helpful at all. We paid the fine, left the hotel in the middle of the night and went to another hotel to stay the night.

We selected the Pullman Park Lane Hotel in Causeway Bay and we were certainly not disappointed. For those needing to stay in quarantine, hopefully these points make sense.These are the three main areas where the hotel really excelled.1) Housekeeping - Both the telephone support and the housekeeping staff were always there to help. From providing endless water, coffee and clean sheets / towels to allowing us to borrow the vacuum cleaner. Also when we asked for a table to eat at, the staff cleverly provided a room service table which ended up being very useful for our day to day work.2) Concierge - Because of the quarantine, we needed to order food from outside and we used Deliveroo. The staff always made sure that they delivered everything to our room extremely quickly. On many occasions, when Deliveroo confirmed that it has been delivered at the hotel, within seconds we heard the doorbell and your staff with the parcel in hand.3) Front desk - The duty manager contacted us every day in the afternoon, just to check that we were all fine and that we did not need anything. This is really great customer service and made us feel extremely welcome.Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone returning to Hong Kong in the current circumstances. We hope to be able to visit again when we can enjoy all of the activities that the hotel has to offer.",1,"Dear Mr. Horton,Thank you for taking the time in sharing your positive experience on TripAdvisor community.

This is our 2nd time staying in this wonderful hotel as it is a perfect choice since my children plan to do mainly shopping.We fondly remembered our stay in 2017 and we were glad to be absolutely right once again. Overall our stay was made memorable by the kind of special service the hotel offers their guests. It’s the thoughtful things that made us feel we were valued.Hannah sent up a sweet macaroons present to my room to greet me on my birthday, a thought which was highly appreciated. Hannah also arranged our check-in making sure my family is comfortable during the whole stay.Breakfast at the Playt has been enjoyable with Helen’s accomodating presence, along with other service staff at the restaurant. I like the way they have arranged to serve plated food (instead of the usual chaotic buffet experience and ambience).We enjoyed our cocktails at Ebb & Flow every evening. It was made delightful with Jekaterina’s attentive service (Wilson as well). They served fine wines and the cocktail food was tasty and portioned just right.  We also had an amazing time at the Skye Bar having drinks with a great view of afternoon HK.Everything about this hotel is amazing. The service, the staff’s professionalism, politeness, their attentiveness to details and dedication to making guests feel special and wonderful. I can’t help but notice that they genuinely love what they do and it comes natural for them to give an extraordinary service like this. The Parklane Hotel is number 1 on my list for hotel in Causeway Bay: great location, highly accessible, very clean and excellent service overall. Highly recommended.

This is our 3rd staycation of the month. After our trash experience with JW Marriott, we did not have high hope on this hotel. However, the team just slowly builds up our confidence by every details they attended to. We checked in at around 12:00pm. The lobby was not very busy, but there were two very demanding groups in front of us trying to squeeze out some free goodies. Since we had booked a club-accessing room, so we were arranged to check in at the lounge instead. Lounge was facing the tolo harbour - not the most impressive harbour but the calm water brings extra harmony to the environment. Room was ready shortly after our check in, it was a mountain facing room. The amenity of the room was okay. The bed was a little too soft and the pillows were not excellent. The room and bath are only separated by a glass panel, which will be a great idea if you are getting a habour view room. The pool policy needs a bit improvement though. We were asked to queue up 30 minutes before the pool opening time in person to get an admission ticket to the pool. I understand that the government has tightened the regulations, but it seems a bit troublesome that I have to wait in person. A better arrangement will be through advanced booking and the hotel can confirm pool attendance 30 mins before. Lounge was great and staff were very attentive. Every time we tried to prepare a pot of tea, there will always be someone stepping in to help. One point is taken away from the lounge because they don't serve afternoon tea. We enjoyed the whole 2 hour free flow of wine from 6 - 8 pm with a good selection of cold cuts. After a good night sleep, we woke up to the breakfast at the lounge again. Similar selections of cold cuts as cocktail hours; but they only offered two options for hot food, with very limited tailored options. I would recommend having the breakfast at the lounge since the cafe breakfast offers very similar options, but a lot more crowded. For a staycation, the location is great. It is away from central Hong Kong, and offers convenient connection to the nature. For business and leisure purpose, I think there can be better choices at the Hong Kong island side. The whole experience was very nice. It is for sure a good staycation option if you want to experience something different than the regular busy Hong Kong.",1,"Dear Kollsman C,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience.

I think the whole process of queuing and getting to our room was around 45 mins to 50 mins.........I think whoever is in charge should have pre planned manpower allocation correctly if they are expecting more customers because of increased bookings via promotions etc. The other staff were trying to be helpful by giving out water.

I admitted that that was our fault and please accept my apology for preventing this tragedy!On 24/09 We ordered room service to be served at 10:00 and we planned to take a rest for two hours and than having lunch at Shatin 18. Prefect! right? But Hyatt forced us to face the dark side of the world! Cruel enough! 10:30-11:00 we heard some hammering sound from the floors above so we called the guest service many times to rectify the situation but the annoying sound still presisted so I asked the guest service to escalate that issue to the management! But it was just the beginning of nightmare11:01 Ms. Katrina Li, Assistant Front Office Manager called my mobile and promised to escalate to the engineering team management stop the renovation work immediately and only resume after we check out on 15:00 11:09 As there was no improvement in the situation and even worser as the technician worked even harder to finish the task. I contacted Katrina again and she promised to enter the room involved to stop the renovation work personally.11:21 Katrina called up again and confirmed that the engineer would stop the innovation work after restall some critical elements for safety reason.11:40 Twenty minutes elapsed but the hammering sounds had no trend of diminishing and so I got no choice but to call Katrina again and she promised to take drastic action immediately!11:50 Thanks God the final peace come to the room and Katrina knocked at my door to apologize! We were so tired and lost the appetite to dine at Shatin 18 so we cancelled the appointment.14:46 Just before we finished pack up of our luggage the damning sound attacked us again!I enclosed four sound clips of the dialogue between Katrina and me for your reference. Even if you did not understand Cantonese please click and listen to our intonation and you might feel how tired I was and how embrassing and sincere Katrina was! I am not blaming on Katrina as she had tried her very best in an attempt to resolve my issue and for the time being she was polite, honest and professional and I have no hesitation to vote my compliment to Katrina! Good job! If I was forced to pick bone from the egg was Katrina had trusted and believed that engineering team would listen to her and suspend their work!I understand that the hotel front office and engineering team at the backstage are always confronting enemies but it didn't mean that you can bring us in as the scapegoat!Let me tell you the whole engineering team is the only party to blame on this issue in the first place! According to industry practice if there is any renovation work to be done the hotel should inform the customer in advance such that they can have a choice to go or not go. If it is an urgent case they should try to minimize the impact on customer, inform the customer before the commencement of work and to provide certain compensation as courtesy and the customer can have choice to accept or not! However this precautionary measures was not found in Hyatt Regency when we check in on 23/09!Complaint against them was launched since 10:30 for almost TWO hours and despite the effort from Katrina they just threw empty promise but did nothing to improve the situation! They stopped on 12:00 but perhaps just for lunch only! Finally they restarted the work at 14:46 before our departure and broke the promise again! Both the engineering team and the respective management team had to bear the prime responsibility of this!However from macroscopic point of view of view Hyatt Regency Shatin senior management has to bear the sole responsibility of this based on the following arguments:(1) There is a Change Management process and the engineering team should estimate on the possible parties, in our case the hotel guests and the front office, that will be affected and inform them in advance. In the situation of hammering sound they should foresee the vertical and horizontal penetration of the noise  to determine the number of rooms that might be effected but I believe no one can answer my question!(2) The escalation channel of the engineering team seems to be ineffective and frankly speaking non existence as I believed front office had tried to stop the renovation work in a bottom up manner from the engineer to their manager and they just threw out empty promise and ignore the guests in the room!(3) There is a conflict between front office customer service and back office engineering team which was not probably handled by the Hyatt Regency Shatin senior managementHowever as reminded by my wife regarding two similar issues in Hyatt Regency Shatin on 24/09/2020 and Hyatt Regency Tsimshatsui on 06/07/2020 we would suspect that there is a deep rooted problem in the management style of Hyatt Hong Kong area that would like to escalate to your attention!For frequent travellers they will bring their own electric kettle and hair dryer for safety hygiene reason but for one night staycation stay we will leave the electric kettle at home and when we are ordering room service we will ask them to send a pot of hot water together with the food! Fair enough!On 24/09/2020 morning when I ordered food from room service we asked for an additional pot of hot water but they forgot! When we called again they seemed to get annoyed, didn't apologise and just said they will send us another pot. Our impression was they assumed that we should boil the water using the kettle in the hotel room so they thought our request was unreasonable and so the request was neglected!Similar thing happened on 06/07/2020 when we stayed at Hyatt Recency Tsimshatsui when we placed order through room service we asked for a pot of hot water and the gentleman on the other side of the phone said""提提你呀!房裏面有熱水煲!""when translated to English means ""Just to remind you there is a electric kettle inside the room"". We had raised the issue on spot and the manager promised to escalate to the senior management for corrective and preventive measures!Just to remind anyone who is reading this email, this is a five star hotel and service agent should try their best effort to fulfill every reasonable request from their guest. In additional I am placing an order and this pot of water is boudled together with the order and I assume they should have no excuse to refuse or neglect this side order!Imagine that I am at your restaurant and placing an order with an additional pot of hot water will you reject me? The only thing you may say is it is an chargeable item and it is felt enough for me to decide to take this offer or not! Another example is there is a microwave oven on the hotel room why didn't Hyatt refuse to take my order and remind me to go downstairs to an convenience store, buy something and reheat it in oven provided inside the room!Gather all the incidents during my three SHORT stays I have reasons to argue that they are no single or individual issues and are norms deeply rooted and disseminated in Hyatt Regency Hong Kong which should draw immediate attention! Although we may never visit Hyatt, please consider my words seriously!I believe Hyatt owe us an apology!",0,NaN,NaN

Such a really nice gesture! The room was very cozy and spacious. Spacious is unheard of for typical HK hotels, but this one has a very generous space indeed. The layout is just comfortable. The bay window was my favourite spot to lounge and relax gazing over the peaceful view of the harbour. I very much enjoyed soaking in the bathtub having my bubblebath. The check in staff was kind enough to inform me to go for an early breakfast at 730 as the crowd would start coming in around 9. It was spot on. I had a peaceful breakfast with not much of a crowd. I was only given one hour to have my breakfast. The service staff was so attentive that no empty plates would linger on the table more than 30 seconds, somehow I felt like I am being rush off to finish my meal. That's the only setback.The staff gave good direction when I told them I wanted to take a walk by the harbour. It was a nice long walk despite the on and off downpour.

This is my second review of Hyatt Regency Shatin of which I hope you’ll find helpful.The Pro:Hyatt Regency Shatin is conveniently located away for an escape from all the HK hustle and bustle, attractive to day/overnight local and Mainland staycation as well as international city visitors alike. The MELO SPA is of outstanding high quality and relaxing as a treat for the wife or enjoyed as a couple. The Cafe is a nice place for entertaining local and passing through Mainland business visitors alike and the Tin Tin bar for enjoying an evening meet-up with friends. The lunch and evening Buffett offering is of very good value and quality and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Head Chef not only for providing a very good Lobster meal but to also providing a very taste bowl of Cheese Fondue. Perfect!Management has been very accommodating and supportive on one of our past staycations when our young daughter suddenly fell ill with high fever on one of our stays. Thank you.The Con:The reason why I’m giving four instead of five stars on this review:No doubt the property has faced some unprecedented financial challenges over the last couple of months mainly due to the Terrorism by your neighbour CUHK. Petrol bombing and literally burning to the ground University Station MTR. I’d hope, as a Hotel, you are distancing yourself from Terrorists and Violence as any Mainland visitor in my business circles is now considering your property as a no-go-zone. I’m very sorry to say that. Likewise, we were considering to perhaps staying with you on 30th June/1st July but because of the close proximity to an unhinged petrol throwing out-of-control bee-hive we reconsider staying at a safer location for staycation on this occasion. This is not your fault but again I do hope you do not support or accommodate CUHK with preferential rates as they are in no deservance of preferential treatment after causing you losses. Nevertheless it is your decision whom you support and likewise a decision of whom will spend money at the property for guaranteeing your survival in light of the current situation.To be frank, except of the items listed in the Pro Section, I do hope that Jay may improve on the pool-side service: It is painstakingly inattentive, slow and sloppy. This is nothing new and has been going on for at least two years now. As much as I appreciate the dedicated life-guard on duty I’d expect pool staff to be a bit more courteous and pro-active in taking orders, providing water, and supplying cutlery and a napkin with served food which is of good quality.The other thing I wish you can improve on are your package offerings: Do not be mistaken and complacent as Word about Service and Value for Money is spreading fast on Social Media amongst HK Staycation Seekers. No Father’s Day Offering was disappointing more so the front desk follow-up whereupon we decided for staying at ICON Hotel. A lost business opportunity.I also would like you to reconsider your smoking policy on the backyard terrace: I understand it is based on a previous complaint (I understand and emphasize) but likewise I can reassure you that you’ll be losing a two-person lunch dinner twice a month by my friends. Your ground floor terrace is large enough for accommodating compromises. The least I like is running through your restaurant and lobby in wet swimming trunks potentially causing a trip hazard for other guests.Regarding COVID Control Measures: I’m not comfortable eating in your indoor ground floor restaurant at the moment. The reason being is staff laying out plates and cutlery on tables for the next sitting whilst potentially contaminated by airborne particles and foot traffic from the lobby to the backyard. Plates and cutlery should be under UV Light until used for disease risk mitigation.I’m hoping to giving you again five stars on my next review. Thank you for your consideration.",1,"Dear theintrepidfox,Thanks for the great review sharing your experience. Your continued support to Hyatt Regency has been extremely encouraging!

During my first night of my stay there was an incident where the manager had called me to say that smoking was not permitted in the room. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aware and I’m not a regular smoker but it just so happened that I did that day. I guess this is my fault however the manager kindly told me that they would exempt me from the smoking fine for that day which I was grateful. I did not smoke the other days of my stay. I decided to extend 1 more night stay on the last day of my booking, however after my booking was made, I received a call from the reception notifying me that I will not be allowed to stay at the hotel anymore and they “frowned upon smoking” . If you’re ban my stay, you should at least notify me beforehand especially not after I made my booking. I did not smoke in the room anymore after being reminded there’s no smoking and there was no need to blacklist me and I didn’t do anything violent or disruptive to the hotel. I have been a long term guest and I didn’t feel I should be treated that way for 1 misunderstanding.

We regret that our staff has found signs of smoking in the room you stayed in during your stay and we have then reminded you that smoking is prohibited in guest room. However, our staff smelled heavy cigarette smell in your room again on the following days when delivering amenities to your room and conducting room cleaning. As it was believed that you have violated our hotel policy of no smoking in rooms even after being reminded, we are sorry that we were unable to accept your room extension and we had to arrange check out for you on your scheduled check out date. We seek your kind understanding that our hotel is now smoke-free hotel and smoking is prohibited inside the guest rooms and within the hotel premises. If guest smokes in the guest room, the quality of stay of other guests will unavoidably be affected. In case we found guest smokes in the guest room, we will have to hold the guest room for deep clean to clear the smoke smell and residue prior to the arrival of the new guests. A cleaning fee will be charged. Apart from the notice of no-smoking on the booking platforms, our Front Desk staff inform every guest about such policy upon check-in and signage has been placed inside guest room as a gentle reminder of not to smoke in room. This is part of the hotel’s service pledge to promote a healthy lifestyle by providing a clean and comfortable accommodation and environment for all our guests.

Whenever we have extra time, even maybe one day or two, we would like to stay in these hotel, and usually, the hotel staff and the guest relation officer always upgrade us to a better room and we are deeply appreciated!But today, as usual, we check-in for one night stay, when we asked the guest relation officer to late check-out until 4:00pm, the guest relation officer can't make the decision, so she asked for advise from her Duty Assistant Manager, Mr. Danny Szeto.When I pointed out that I am requesting a late check-out at 4:00pm, as two weeks ago, when we stay in the same hotel ( as we are a frequent customer ), the guest relation manager gave us a late check-out until 4:00pm, that is why we are asking the same thing this time. But Mr. Danny Szeto said that this hotel is fully book and cannot allow.We said that he was lying as during Coronavirus period, only Hong Kong resident will stay in these hotel and there is a lot of room left and cannot be fully booked. Also, I pointed out that last month I stay at a 5`Stars hotel and that hotel also allowed us to stay til 4:00 pm, why he can't?Mr. Danny Szeto said that why don't you go and stay at that hotel if they allowed you to stay until 4:00pm, why you come to this hotel?  This really pissed me off, we are your customer, you ( Mr. Danny Szeto) said something like this to his customer, is this is the way a hotel staff treat their Royal customer?

The front desk officer Ms. Rode Ma doesn't trust us that both of our room aren't working, she continues said that she checked on the front desk and the door was active, after few minutes talk, she finally personally come up with us and try both room key by herself as she doesn't trust us at all. After she came up and try out both room key and found out it didn't work, then she called the housekeeping to open the door for us. I was furious for the following:1). Ms. Rode Ma doesn't trust me that both key aren't working, has to personally come up and test it out.2). Ms. Rode Ma should asked the housekeeping to stand by at our room, in case the room can't opened, and housekeeping can immediately open the room for us.3). Ms. Rode Ma should not argued with us, she even said to us (with a smiley face) "" what do you want me to do?, You can called police if you want to "" right after she found out she had make a mistake but didn't admit. I wonder whether the hotel training are aware of staffs attitude, manner ? How fluent the training is conducted?  Why the staff said such a thing to their customer?  In conclusion, I still love to stay in this lovely hotel and I still like the facilities, but the staff should really, really have proper training in order to serve the customer better!Thank you very much for your attention!",0,NaN,NaN

It made our travels easier and we're able to maximize our stay because of its excellent location - it's near to HK-Macau Ferry Station, Star Ferry Terminal, and accessible to Metro, Bus, Taxi, and Ding Ding Tram. There's a Thai Restaurant in the hotel but it is also surrounded by local restos, food chains, and 7-Eleven. Man Mo Temple is just 5-minute walking from the hotel.

A big thank you to Mr. Timothy because he was very helpful during our check-in. Without his considerations, we couldn't have enjoyed our first day that much. His actions are highly appreciated and commendable.To the housekeeping staff who were so nice and granted some of our requests, thank you so much.And last but not the least, to Mr. Willis - thanks for the late check-out. Sometimes things were out of our hands and we just need extra time. And we're so thankful for that. He also assisted us on our way out, called a taxi for us, and spoke to the driver for our destination.

Familiar to us were Hong Kong and Singapore with Macau, Taiwan and Laos the new places we visited. We chose the Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong SoHo as our accommodation for our 2 night short stay on Hong Kong Island mainly for its excellent location.  We included Hong Kong in our travel plans so we could enjoy a Grayline HK afternoon and evening tour of Hong Kong Island which culminated with a Dinner cruise on the Bauhinia taking in the Hong Kong Symphony of Lights on Hong Kong Harbour.  Sadly it rained for much of this tour which spoilt the enjoyment at the top of Victoria Peak.  However we enjoyed the experience of the Dinner Cruise and the Aberdeen fishing village boat ride.  The Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong Soho is conveniently located at Sheung Wan Hong Kong, and close to the Macau Ferry Terminal. This was an important factor as our next stopover was our 2 night stay in neighbouring Macau.   The hotel is a very tall building towering a number of its neighbouring buildings in Sheung Wan.We found our guestroom at the Holiday Inn Express had a comfortable bed and reasonable facilities with a good sized writing desk and quite a view of the tall skyscraper buildings of Hong Kong Island and a glimpse of Hong Kong Harbour.   The bathroom was clean with adequate facilities.  The shower unit was very easy to operate.  The hotel provided an electricity adaptor for western appliances in the room which was a good feature. A pleasing experience at the hotel was the breakfasts on both mornings in the Moon Thai Restaurant on level two run independent of the hotel. The restaurant provided an excellent buffet style breakfast which included all the usual western favourites such as eggs, bacon, sausages and baked beans. Also thrown in were a few Asian specialities including noodles and tasty spring rolls.  The decor of the restaurant was modest but tasteful.   We were not long enough in Hong Kong to try the Restaurant for an evening meal. As hotels go the Holiday Inn Express met our needs for our short stay on Hong Kong Island..",0,NaN,NaN

Post COVID wave - the hotel must have fired all their staff and new staff haven’t caught up on their training. The hotel check in was ridiculously slow, it took over an hour to check in. I believe they did learn and get people to do their health checks whilst waiting in line the following day. There was no social distancing with people lining up for slow check in, and also the shuttle bus into town. The kids room still closed. With beaches still closed we were relying on the pool. However, the pool had maximum capacity of 40 people, meaning that it was impossible to get in. We booked via agoda and assumed breakfast booked was the buffet breakfast as described by previous posts. Unfortunately it was a very sad and terrible set breakfast. As we adjust to the new normal and post pandemic travel, there was definitely room for improvement. The room we got was clean and basic. It had a nice view of the pool.

We were picked up from Sunny Bay on the morning of the 20th, as arranged by the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, right along the sea side and directly adjacent to a small complex with various food and drink options. Our ocean view suite was very well furnished, with beautiful panoramic views of the sea, as well as a sizable living room, bedroom, and bathroom with a bathtub - from where you can also enjoy the sky-sea view! For my daughter's birthday, we had dinner in the buffet restaurant in the hotel, where the service and food were both great - and they even gifted us a birthday cake and a bottle of wine! The next morning, we had a large buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and afterwards, we rented bikes from the hotel to tour around the area. My daughter also went for a swim in the pool, which overlooks the sea. Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Auberge Hotel - the service, location, facilities were all of great quality - and I would highly recommend it for any families or couples looking to get away from the city for a short trip!",0,NaN,NaN

This was my 1st time we have stayed in this hotel, and I have the worst experience here at all. We have arrived hotel after 2pm, the lobby already crowded with too many people waiting for check in. We came to this hotel in a relaxed and exciting mood so we understand it suddenly comes a peak period during pandemic issue, but guest should expected you have sufficient experience and resources to handle it well. We have waited around 10 minutes for check in and the front desk staff was not very friendly. What i mostly concerned was the service standard of a hotel in Discovery Bay claimed a 4-star hotel. Also, I am wondering if this hotel with good arrangement, as i know there are some packages has extended late check out until 1pm, but the check in time for other packages is 3pm, do you have any sufficient time and rooms to do this turnover? As the staff told us that they didn't have room available at that moment due to we have requested high floor =.=. When we asked the time for the room ready, they just reply: NO IDEA without any apologize. After that, we have asked any late check out can be arranged for us, they told us that they can only arrange for late check out until 12:30pm as they were running high occupancy. I understand that late check out request will be subject to hotel availability but if Hotel is NO IDEA of what time is available for room ready, then, why they announced their check in time is 3pm online? If room cannot be ready at 3pm, I think hotel staff can contact guest in advance, otherwise, it will waste much of the time to wait for a ROOM!If the room need late for us, then we can reschedule of our plan as on that day was raining outside, we have no room and cannot use any facility in the day time at the hotel. If hotel can informed us earlier, then we can come later, but hotel did nothing. Finally, we have waited more than 2 Hours to get our room at around 5pm, this is out of our expectation, before we can get our room, we have asked the front desk few time for the time which room will ready, they never apologize or compensate. And staff insist to tell us no any late check out to us until next day morning. I am sure that there will be next customer to happen again next. I hope that above comments can assist this hotel to maintain their service quality to serve locally and of course, internationally, it is critical to keep the good impression of Hong Kong to everyone. For the time being will resume normal later on, i think it is a good experience for you and your teams to prepare to serve other customers during Peak Season in future.",0,NaN,NaN

First impression was terrible though, as we arrived 2:15 pm and only got our first room key at 3:15 pm and our last room key at 3:45 pm.   They really should figure out a more efficient check-in process.  Three rooms were ocean view rooms and the parents were in a suite with mountain views.  The suite was very spacious by HK standards and had a view of the pool and a glimpse of the beach. The three ocean rooms all had stunning seaviews.  I woke up at dawn with a room awashed with warm light, which immediately brought back fond memories of a gorgeous holiday once upon a time in Sorrento, Italy.  All rooms were clean and the bathrooms’ showers also had fantastic views.    Service was good, they provided proper plates and forks for a cake preordered from their cafe and room service was prompt with other requests.   The beach nearby was clean, had a great vibe, and soundtracked by rustling trees.  Access was easy as we took an uber/ferry/DB bus on the way in and a much easier 40 min cabride on the way out, definitely a nice option for family trips during Covid days.  ",0,NaN,NaN

Although it’s only a 4 stars hotel, I give the view of this hotel a rating of 5 stars.  However, the service was not impressive.  One of my objective staying here is to really spend some time on meditating, relax, and focusing on myself.  I meditated during afternoon, but that’s when the house keeping came by, during my first day of stay.  I let the housekeeping in, while continuing my meditation.  She came in and out like a tornado, making a lot of noise, and very sloppy cleaning my room.  My meditation was interrupted.  That night I realised my crystal was missing.   I looked for my crystal all night and didn’t know where it went.  So the manager came and looked for the crystal with me, and realized the house keeper unawarely sweep the crystal at the gap of the bed when changing the bedding.  Then the next day I put up the non disturb sign at my door.  I had a few moment of peacefulness without any disturbance, and then they started calling in every 20 mins, I ignored them as I was meditating.  Then the next 20 mins someone came up.  I cannot blamed them for dropping by, but I literally felt pressured like I was being chased for my room to be cleaned, so I asked them to come again in 30 mins.  I think maybe their English wasn’t very good, so no one came by at the end of the day.  So I rang the front desk and asked someone to clean up my room.  The cleaning lady came by and was kind of rude.  I asked her to take off her shoes while entering my room, because this is a critical period.  She said they have to wear shoes, and insist on wearing it.  What she said to me next really surprised me, as it came out from the cleaning lady’s mouth.  She literally just say it to my face the floor are very dirty, so she needs to step into my room with the shoes that she stepped outside the virus dirty floor.  That lady didn’t really clean my room, but emptied the bins and left.  Someone please correct me if my logic are wrong.  I know this is not a 5 stars hotel, but that attitude was terrible!The hygiene of this hotel doesn’t impressed me already, but after what that cleaning lady said, and seeing how she ‘cleaned up’ my room.  I highly doubted the overall hygiene of the hotel.  I wish they have a better management and training for the hotel staff, otherwise this would be a wonderful hotel to stay.  ",0,NaN,NaN

There is a pier 10mins walk away to Kowloon side or if you want a lovely walk along the boardwalk to Central piers and the AIA wheel , that's about 20mins. The pool is lovely and gets sun for a good portion of each day. The fitness room adequate though very cold from the air conditioning. Breakfast is ok, again only adequate.

I like the location a lot. the rooms are nice, modern and tidy but the staff I've encountered are generally not very eager to help, provide solution or provide any alternatives, especially the front office which are suppose to help but apparantly not doing so. Generally I'm very understanding regarding hotel experience but to have me write this negative review means I am quite triggered by the continuous mistreat and nonchalant from the front desk. Here are some issues I've had staying in this hotel1. I knew there are noisy renovation work, Ived stayed before during the day. There are rooms that are more far away from the noisy work, which I really appreciate. Until one time, ive been assigned in a room that is too noisy to bear. I gave the front desk a call to request a room change to the other side of the corridor, which is furher away from the noisy work. And the answer I got from a staff was a simple “no, all the rooms are the same” which I knew it wasnt true. A direct no2. I've always asked for a double bed when I check in. The answer is always no, they are full. Even during this time, when the tourism business is not as great, no sure how hey are full. After a few times, I stopped asking.  And they will not tell you the bed type you've given during check in. until you went up to the room and find it out yourself, it is usually a twin. If you called to request a room change for a double bed, expect it to be a no. 3. The application in the TV in each room is not consistent. We enjoy watching netflix in the room but somehow not every TV in their rooms allow you to use that application even when it is installed already. And each time when we check in, we just hope and pray that the room TV has a working netflix. Mostly it is not working. We have talked to the front desk once regarding this issue during one of our stay previously. The solution was to wait until next day because the technician for this Netflix issue would be available the next day. which to me sounds like a complete bs trying to get me off the line. And we just let it go and didnt bother anymore.4. Shower water temperature in the early morning is cold and takes 10 to 15 mins of running water to heat up.5. This triggers me the most, bedding issue again and staff literally dont care. I always book on ctrip. And there are no option to chose a double or twin. I've seen on their official website, there are also no option to choose a twin or double. Like the first point on this review, it is always a no if you request a double. and They will always say your booking is a twin, they are full. Is it because we booked on ctrip and not directly through your website therefore we get this firm denial with zero flexibility everytime and we are seen as lower tier guests? it happens for a few times, okay I understand but it is every single time. Just today I made an extension of my stay in 1706, I called earlier before *noon* in hope to request to change to a double bed and wish that I wont get their standard “we are full you booked a twin answer” and yes I get that again. With no alternatives offered from the front desk after that standard answer, I suggested to have a room that we can combine the bed, that would be fine too. Well it is still a “no, the bed cannot be combined”. The attitude is like stop bothering me, this is what you get, take it or leave it. To sum it up. Nice room, poor service.",1,"Dear Guest,serve you in the near future Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at Wharney Hotel.

This is a very well managed property by the National Hotel Group, offering up spacious, smartly-arranged suites at very affordable rates in Sheung Wan. 99 Bonham has become our favourite place to stay down in the city this year. Worth note, we've found room rates to be better directly on the hotel website compared to what has been made available through various booking websites that we normally use. Reservation confirmations are immediate and payments are processed quickly upon arrival. Staff are professional, helpful, polite and oh so friendly. They are easily the most likeable that we have found at any hotel in Hong Kong in recent years. The three suite types are as advertised. Pictures on the website match exactly what you will find. Lots of space, comfortable beds and nice furnishing, all expected amenities and really impressive views from the floor to ceiling glass windows. Housekeeping is timely and of high standard. There are laundry machines on every other floor, a 1st floor gym and one of Hong Kong's very best (37th floor) rooftops where you can enjoy an evening glass of wine and admire the outstanding views of Hong Kong's famous skyline and parts of Victoria Peak and Harbour. As for location, couldn't be better. The property is just a couple minutes walk from the Sheung Wan MTR entrance and you'll find loads of good restaurants, a few good coffee shops and quality bars in the area. Many great restaurants also make food delivery here as well, perfect for these pandemic times and simply enjoying your meal inside your suite with the lovely skyline views. Overall, we couldn't be more pleased with 99 Bonham. I would like to say we have just been very lucky with this property but when they have done a great job each time we've stayed with them.

The staff were nice, and the room is clean and tidy. However, I have an unpleasant checkout experience in my recent stay. The hotel staff called me for the first time around 12:10 and told me that the checkout time is 12:00. I acknowledged it and replied to the staff that I am packing already with an apology. The second call came around 30 minutes later but I missed it. The third call came around 12:50 and the staff asked us to checkout right away as there are guests waiting for the room. In the end, I arrived the reception around 13:20. After returning the room key to Angela Li, the Guest Service Manager on duty, asked me to pay HKD$110 right away without any explanation. I was shocked about it and did not know how does this charge incur. Therefore, I asked for an explanation from Angela. She explained that it is due to the late checkout and had already mentioned in one of the calls. However, I never heard anything regarding the charges. I asked Angela, and another staff, Daisy Hong, whether they can provide black & while terms and conditions regarding the calculation of late checkout charges. Unfortunately, they are unable to provide it. I understand my checkout time is late and willing to pay for the late checkout charges. After I paid, I was surprised that they did not print a receipt for me. Nevertheless, they printed the receipt for me after I ask for it and reminded me to double-check whether I have packed all of my personal belongings or not.All in all, I believe the staff charged me according to the hotel’s standard operating procedures. However, I am a little bit disappointed regarding the service standard.1. Staff ask me to pay HKD$110 at the reception but did not mention the reason for the charges until I ask for clarification2. The staff did not provide the receipt proactively after I paid.3. The staff did not mention about late checkout charges in the calls.4.

We checked in just before midnite. Although the district is a bit dark on the roads, this new hotel glitters like a gem at the back of the buildings. Staff was friendly and efficient. In no time we arrived at our room on high floor. Size of the room and amenities were adequate against its price of below hk$500. Very clean and equipped with the usual bathroom amenities of Hilton from the Crabtree. We tried the breakfast the next morning which was served in the chinese restaurant. Breakfast was in sets with choice of Chinese, western or vegetarian, supplemented with buffet style drinks, bread, fruit and cereal. The taste was only average and I would definitely opt for the 750 points instead next time as not far from the hotel are fast food shops and restaurants selling food of much better taste. However the swimming pool remained closed even the Government had already lifted the ban. Need to mention the staff there were most friendly including the housekeeping staff who greeted us, the restaurant waitresses who cleared our the tables very efficiently, and the front desk staff Mr Howard Au in particular who helped clear my questions. He even called me afterwards to further clarify and ease my concerns. Only later I found out Howard is the Assistant Guest Service Supervisor of the hotel. In all, my experience of my first stay there was very good! Better than expected!",1,"Dear Guest,Thank you for your review of your past stay with our Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok .

This was my partner and my first experience at Hilton Garden Inn property. The check-in process was swift, efficient, and attentive. Hats off and extra recognition for GSM - Joseph for his over the top service attitude. Both my partner and I felt extremely welcomed. Must say that the most things from the check-in to check-out, room's cleanliness, and overall staff had exceeded our expectations. The seals on the room doors, and the littler extra gestures to suggest thorough cleaning had been done made it that much easier for us to ease in and enjoy the room to its full potential. IF there was one thing to address, it would be our experience at Eagle's Nest. Which left us with much to desire. Still a venue with great potential nonetheless. The location was easy to find and  quite accessible to other public transportations. Only about a 10-15 min walk to the nearest MTR station, and has 24HRS access to supermarkets and convenience stores nearby. Definitely a top value pick amongst their other competitors in the area.

The hotel was well-maintained and basically felt secure. To a person, the Front Desk staff were excellent. On a daily basis, before we left the hotel, they would provide advice as to expected large local gatherings and areas we should avoid within the city. Our experience with the hotel's restaurant, however, was not stellar, but the breakfast buffet was excellent. A nice blending of East and West tastes provided a great variety of foods, and made-to-order items were also available. They even brought out gluten free breads for us upon request. We have reviewed the Eagle's Garden Restaurant separately. We understand that the hotel's owner loves the player piano music from the bar area, which was actually quite nice. However, the volume should be lowered so as not to negatively impact conversations taking place at the Front Desk. At times, one needed to almost yell to be heard. Also, because the hotel is cornered on well-trafficked streets, we observed a number of locals enter the hotel, seat themselves in the lobby and/or bar areas, and proceed to enjoy various food items from their shopping bags, purses, etc. in the presence of hotel guests trying to themselves enjoy snacks and drinks. There should probably be better control over the wandering locals. All in all, the several times we were at the Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok during our recent trip, the stays were superb.

WoC still a great place to enjoy a meal, where we had lunch on our 2nd day...besides the usual a-la-carte menu, there was a (seasonal?) brunch menu with good choices that included starters, mains and desserts, price-worthy, .but mainly we love the dining atmosphere here, bright and airy....we didnt try room service this time, but it's still available, as is takeway service from the restaurants. Rain Drop pool is still and awesome place to de-stress...the gardens seemed quite popular with families stretched out enjoying the sun, if not having a picnic..the indoor kids' playroom is open this time, w/capacity controlThe Lodge, this hotel is really a relaxing place to be, the lobby's big enough you never feel crowded, even when walking the grounds...the CMs everywhere are always ready to assist, if not just have welcome greetings or a smile..well, actually nowadays, its called 'smeyesing'...and so, although we were not able to experience the new Adventure's Suite, this review cant end without thanking our 'behind-the scenes' friends, Fannie/Fanny/Romeo for your pre-arrival assistance...also these ladies and gentlemen: Karl at check in, and the other CMs, Crystal, Ariel, Joey @FO, Joe/Alex from HSKP (i think), Hoey from Gst Services, Edmund/Brandon/Cherry/Kaman but especially IVY @ Dragon Wind ...guests are in good hands when with these ladies and gentlemen......including the CMs @WoC, especially those we met during lunch (no names as I forgot to take note, wrongly trusting my memory coz now ive forgotten after a week..my bad)..but we do have to say that the cakes were appreciated and delicious...sorry we couldnt try the gelato as we were really full from your brunch..maybe next time...and last but not least, to our new friend, Joe Fung @ Front Office'Yo!

It has a good bus connection to the theme park and is a short walk (or bus) to the Disney section of the MTR. You can also walk to the theme park along the sea front path which takes about 20 minutes. It’s a lovely walk and takes you past the Honk Kong Disneyland hotel. The food on property is expensive but you are a bit of a captive audience. We did sample some of the food trucks on the way into the park which were a cheaper option.

Cast members ushered us into the hotel with waving Mickey hands and Kin welcomed us by name. We were whisked away to our Adventurers Suite where the magic truly came to life. The double doors opened up to an Adventureland Disney attraction. Mickey and Minnie's suitcase lay open in the entry way closet (one of my favorite details) and the pictures and artifacts from their journeys adorn every table and wall. The cast members explained that Mickey and Minnie had gone on a journey, but they have left a chest for us to open. In order to do this, we first needed to decipher the clues found on pieces of a treasure map hidden around the suite. Along with this treasure hunt, Mickey and Minnie left us a special flashlight to use find even more secrets hidden around the room. My husband and I were delighted in the way the cast members stayed in character and brought the whole adventure to life for us! The suite itself is beautifully adorned with every artefact and painting bringing the story to life. The cast member set up treats and fruit upon our arrival and conducted the check in in the dining room. They worked with us to create vegetarian meals, which we greatly appreciated.As part of the perks, we were given pizza, chips, and fries by the pool in a private cabana soon after arrival. They placed an order for us at the Crystal Lotus in the Disneyland Hotel for our take out dinner (Hong Kong does not allow dining in restaurants after 6 due to the pandemic, so the hotel has created take out menus), and then drove us over to the hotel in the Explorers Lodge themed Defender! This is probably one of the best moments of my life. They offered to have it delivered, but I really wanted to ride in the hotel Land Rover. Breakfast the next morning was delivered to our room and beautifully set up. We ate Nemo waffles with the beautiful Hong Kong  horizon as our view. Further amenities include a themed Switch system set up on their very large screen with many complimentary games to play and many Disney movies on Blu Ray to watch. Up is my favorite option of the bunch. The cast even went above and beyond to honor our late check out at guests who have previously stayed on property. Because the Adventurer Suite is so popular, we were not able to stay in the room past eleven, but they did open up another room for us so we could continue to enjoy the hotel amenities until one. The entire cast of this hotel, treated us with attentive kindness from the minute we arrived on property. We look forward to our next expedition to the Adventurer Suite in the Explorers Lodge Hotel.

The phone check-in was smooth and Cast Member did a great job by not only introducing room facilities but also provide several dining suggestions for us. The call demonstrated her professionalism in her knowledges of the hotel.The arrival experience was truly one of a kind. The Land Rover Defender used for picking up guests from MTR station to Disney Explorer Lodge is exotic. It quickly immersed guests into the adventure of unknown. I was specially touched by the greetings of several Cast Members who put on the Mickey Gloves. It has been such a long time since my last visit to Disney Explorer Lodge due to pandemic. This warm welcome really made myself feel like home. My journey continued with a quick introduction of surrounding elements and escort to the suite. A special shout out to Front Desk Cast Members who introduced the background story of the Adverturers Suite not only by their words, but also by their acts. Greatly appreciated on their attention to details and their designed dialogs to leave several mysteries for us. A special thanks to F&B & Housekeeping team on their welcome snacks and towel cakes!The room decorations were truly amazing. Entering the room, you would feel like you have entered a basecamp at the centre of Amazon Rainforest but not an ordinary guest-room. I especially like the backstory of the room that could put guests into the room for Mickey & Minnie Mouse, who happened to gone out for another adventure. The first thing that caught my eyes was the huge Mickey & Minnie's suitcase with their belongings and life-sized shoes. The room was also full of their personal collections gathered around the world such as the Jungle River Cruise boat model as well as Maui's magical fish hook. It took us hours to try to photograph all these little hidden tributes to Disney movies and parks. The in-room treasure hunt is fun and yet challenging but the reward of the hunt was worthwhile. The most impressive decoration was the UV effects on the ceiling and the wall since they are truly out-of-expected. I loved all these elements in the room which are suitable for guests of all ages. The interior designs had great impacts on compensating the outdoor view of the room although it is not a great sea view room. The room was spacious and the soundproof of the room was exceptional even it is located right above lobby. In-room entertainments were ample and suitable for larger group especially with Nintendo Switch. The room also offered us Snack Platter by the pool with cabana reserved with great portion and super chill environment.We moved to World Of Color for dinner at night, although I would recommend the hotel could provide a tailored in-room dining menu to let guests could enjoy the time at room, especially with the wooden big dinner table! On the other hand, the breakfast did a great job by directly delivering into the room. I personally think it even better than the Kingdom Club lounge in Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel as direct-to-room breakfast took good use of the room facilities. Finally, please allow me to thank you again for all of your efforts to make my journey completed. The direct line given enable us to have direct access to Cast Members as our personal guide during our “adventure”. Extremely grateful to all Cast Members who assisted our departure and resolved some of our remaining mysteries regarding the room decoration and treasure hunt.

We stayed at Disney Explorers Lodge to be away from the city due to the uncertain times. Our first impressions of the hotel were great! The lobby was expansive and grand, the gardens were beautiful and the theming was subdued but stylish. We stayed in a Double Room with Sea View. This room was bigger than expected (ample room for three of us), with two large king sized beds and a large well appointed bathroom.  Disney Explorers Lodge amenity kits were provided, along with the standard Disney amenities. The room was amazing and the view over gardens and to the water spectacular! There are 3 restaurants/cafes on the property which all serve great food and snacks (especially the Mickey Waffles!).  We even got to meet Mickey and Goofy at breakfast on our first morning! The attention to detail in the hotel, gardens and restaurants was also great! The staff were all extremely friendly and happy to help. During the check in process, the member of staff noticed it was my birthday in around 3 weeks so gave me a 'Happy Birthday' pin. The next day, Housekeeping made a 'Chip and Dale' arrangement with small wash towels and pipe cleaners to take home as a special birthday gift! This was completely unexpected and a lovely Disney surprise! We didn't actually go to Disneyland this trip but transport to the park was easy and convenient.  It was also a straightforward train trip into the city and sites of Hong Kong.

I have tried this brand Cozi in other locations before. All quite good, new, value for money, great price. The hotel, next to a canal, is 3-min away from Tuen Mun metro station on foot. There are several themes for different floors, Japanese, Greece, Thai and African. We were on the highest floor (13/F) Japanese theme. Hotel has a nice and interesting decor everywhere. Train is the theme. The room is twin standard. Very small, like the one of inn in Japan. No space to place suitcase, no proper desk or seat for reading. We had to watch TV on the bed.  Room clean with sufficient provisions like slippers, safe, toiletries, towels. Shower is hot and strong which is good. Air con cool strong and sensitive, good too. Bedding clean and white. Housekeeping can do better as I saw a hair (not from head) on the toilet seat when I opened the cover after checkin. We had a dinner buffet here too, 75% discount for guests. There're several decent and grand malls around, immediately opposite is V City. I had a walk in the Tuen Mun Park nearby. Cozy and relaxing. Staff service not too good. No smile no enthusiasm, although did the job barely. Look not happy to work here. Overall a quite good stay.

The room is furnished comfortably, I can have my cat stay here with me, and the staff are attentive, friendly and very helpful. I enjoy the atmosphere and neighbourhood and it feels very safe. My room gets cleaned weekly, and anytime repair needs doing, the handyman is diligent and quick to help. The building has a nice common area to hang out in with friends, which is great when you want to have people over but don't have enough space in your room. Better yet is the rooftop garden, which is a rare luxury in Hong Kong and it's beautiful and has a great view.Location is also convenient with Mong Kok nearby and multiple MTR stations in walking distance. Laundry is available in the building but you do have to pay for it and it's not quite as cheap as some self service laundromats I have used; however you do pay the price for convenience.I hope to stay here long term!",0,NaN,NaN

I was in a separate block apart from the main resort building, which was great. The room was spacious with 2 beds (bigger than single but didn't look as big as a double) and a sliding door window (which didn't open) looking onto the ocean, which was beautiful. Except for the 3 main lights (bathroom, passage outside bathroom, 1 wall light opposite beds), none of the others (2 bedside lamps, 1 standing lamp, 1 desk lamp) worked. Luckily it was enough light for me to use my laptop at night, but inconvenient and did not give a great impression of care. The carpets had marks on them and the decor is old and outdated. The saving grace is the beautiful sea view onto Silvermine beach.There were tv channels that showed only English or Chinese options, and others that showed that it could be in either English or Chines. When I tried using a channel advertised in English or Chinese and couldn't do it and called reception to find out how to change it to English, I was told that it couldn't be done. No point in printing it could be in either English or Chinese, when in fact that wasn't the case.The vegetarian breakfast was not terribly good - very standard quality. Others who had breakfast at the sea facing restaurant with me did not enjoy the quality of the pork sausage and ham (very processed and low quality) or the bread, but the lady who served us (Gloria) is lovely, charming and friendly. The grounds are quite nice and had facilities been open it may have been better, but due to covid 19 regulations, wasn't. The reception staff were friendly enough and I was given permission to leave my bicycle inside the perimeter of the resort locked up, which was kind (as there is signage very clearly stating that this is not allowed).My niece ended up not staying with me after all, and I was told by reception that generally, they do not allow only 1 person to stay in a room, and it has to be 2 people or more. I find this so odd, as I am a single woman and have often booked into hotels on my own. Penalized for being single? Ridiculous!!!Would I stay there again?

Few hotels in Hong Kong offer as many advantages and attractions as The Charterhouse, especially at such an unreal and unbeatable price!  Whatever your purpose ~ business, pleasure, tourism, shopping & food, etc ~ you will find The Charterhouse's location to be remarkably strategic ~ everything you want and need, right at your fingertips!  Please allow me to take you now on a quick tour, beginning inside The Charterhouse, then moving outward into our beloved, fascinating Hong Kong!Your room speaks warmly of cozy Old English ~ refreshingly high ceilings; rustic, rounded, wooden desk & cabinets; and a varnished bedside table & nightstand.  Tasteful ivory-colored, gold-brimmed lamps abound, so that your choices of lighting are plentiful as they are beautiful.  Your room's walls are thick & guarded, ideal for privacy and quiet reflection.  In fact, with the drapes shut and the lights out, nothing could make for better shut-eye!  As for your view:  one large window, robed with sheer curtains and heavy drapes, awaits your advance.  Undress it before the southern exposure, and behold:  Hong Kong's stunning, precipitous mountains, all punctuated by buildings of enthralling variety and dimension!  And get ready for the night:  this intriguing display turns luminously intoxicating ~ almost other-worldly!  And as for the mountains:  clad thickly with jungle and secret trails, they reach bravely into heavenly heights, where gentle mists, wandering clouds, and island breeze drift lazily over ridge and peak, hailing from such choice getaways as Stanley Market, Deep Water Bay, and Shek O.  Exiting your room, you will find literally all the hotel staff to be unbelievably exceptional ~ from the housekeeping staff, to the front desk and management crew (level three), to the concierge attendants below (ground level)!  Exit The Charterhouse, and immediately to your right is a key, strategic bus stop, which facilitates quick arrival to coveted destinations and areas throughout Hong Kong Island!  Pacific Place Shopping Centre is one such place, and its comprehensive, international supermarket, Great Food Hall (Basement level 1~ includes dine-in & dine-out options) is something you certainly don't want to miss out on!A mere seven-minute stroll from The Charterhouse will take you to Hong Kong's Happy Valley Racecourse, where you can conveniently catch busses to such charming places as Stanley Market, Ocean Park, and Central's Mid~Levels (home to countless restaurant-, cuisine- and cafe-choices)!  Incidentally, Times Square, Sogo, the HK Island trams, and Victoria Park (including its inviting marina & boardwalk), are also just within minutes' walking distance from The Charterhouse!  A similar length's walk in the other direction will take you to the Wan Chai MTR, and just beyond that, to the Wan Chai Ferry!  A delightful, scenic 10-min ferry ride across the Victoria Harbour is all it takes to get you to HK's famous waterfront promenade, Avenue of Stars ~ the cool and lively welcoming forefront of Hong Kong's historic Kowloon Peninsula!  As for food, cafes, and shopping near The Charterhouse, the variety and number of choices available to you are endless!

Very accessible and very big shopping mall nearby with lots of dining options! I must say, I'm quite impressed with the room. It was really clean, no moldy smell and really spacious! I was given a complimentary upgrade to a City Cornerview Room! Really appreciate and was happy about it. I had a nice city view with partial seaview at the side since the room had a panoramic glass windows! Kuddos to Chloe Tung for the great hospitality and swift check-in process. Despite the busy situation at the lobby, she was very thorough and maintained her professionalism. She was very nice to us! Thanks Chloe! Special thanks to Ada Chan (Housekeeper) on the 32/F for assisting in setting up the extra bed and sending up extra amenities. She was very kind to us. If the room was done by her, it needs some credits! Pls send my thanks to her! Regarding the buffet, they have ample choices. It's not the best compared to my other hotel experiences but it does cover the basics. I think the hotel could consider adding few more main course dishes (lunch buffet). There was only a few of them on the buffet table.  Wanted to swim in their pool but unfortunately HK Observatory issued thunderstorm warning signal in the 2 days I stayed, so no chance of swimming. Too bad haha My family and I walked around the hotel to check out their facilities, we happen to walk by the 47/F which was a bar & restaurant.

Long story short, this hotel is located at one of the very convenient place (5-7mins walking distance from Sheung Wan sta.) in Hong Kong Island and yet offers a very reasonable price and good quality service.Below I have summarises points that may be of interest for someone who is considering Travelodge as an option.Desk/work space: depending on the layout of the room, you may find the space somewhat limited. For me, the space was enough to use laptop and ipad.Laundry: no laundry machine in the room but there are several self laundry service facilities  (1min walk) and shops that offers you laundry service (3mins walk). Travel lodge also offers the service but cost slightly higher than the street.Room service: you’ll have the room and the bed cleaned up 2 times every week and you’ll also get numbers of bottle of waters replenished each time. I find this extremely convenient for a single man like me who is extremely lazy for such things.Utility: apparently it is all free. Given high humidity in Hong Kong, I had kept my room’s air conditioner on for 24 hours to keep the room condition decent and avoid having my clothes and leather shoes go moody (for no cost).Daily necessities / restaurant S : there are multiple Seven Elevens (24hrs open), drag stores, super markets and diverse types of restaurants in 1-5mins working distant. No stress in shopping and foods.Fridge: no freezer and very compact fridge in the room. Given the size of it, you may not expect to keep too many stuffs in it but as mentioned above, supermarket is nearby, so I can easily stop by the supermarket to fulfil your needs at the time of needs.Others:  only the negative that I may had with Travelodge was the quality of the soundproof. I have to say it is extremely poor as if there is no wall in between your neighbour. This however was not a huge problem with me as I was out for work all day and I’d slept in bed with headsets, but I imagine it could be very frustrating for some people. Above all, I am very satisfied with Travelodge. Concierge is always nice, very attentive and supportive. I had a very pleasant stay here and I’m most likely use it next time again when I come back to Hong Kong.Hope the above helps for to the consideration!",1,"dear kentarof,thank you for your comments and we are happy to know that you had a great stay with us. we always strive to render our guests excellent staying experience like yours and we will surely keep the spirit up in the future. we hope you will also recommend our hotel to your friends and relatives so that they can enjoy a great stay in our hotel as you did.best regards,joyce chingguest services manager","Responded December 13, 2021","best option for a person with plans to have long stay in hong kong. this review is based on my stay at travelodge for 4.5months towards end of 2021. long story short, this hotel is located at one of the very convenient place (5-7mins walking distance from sheung wan sta.) in hong kong island and yet offers a very reasonable price and good quality service.below i have summarises points that may be of interest for someone who is considering travelodge as an option.desk/work space: depending on the layout of the room, you may find the space somewhat limited. for me, the space was enough to use laptop and ipad.laundry: no laundry machine in the room but there are several self laundry service facilities  (1min walk) and shops that offers you laundry service (3mins walk). travel lodge also offers the service but cost slightly higher than the street.room service: you’ll have the room and the bed cleaned up 2 times every week and you’ll also get numbers of bottle of waters replenished each time. i find this extremely convenient for a single man like me who is extremely lazy for such things.utility: apparently it is all free. given high humidity in hong kong, i had kept my room’s air conditioner on for 24 hours to keep the room condition decent and avoid having my clothes and leather shoes go moody (for no cost).daily necessities / restaurant s : there are multiple seven elevens (24hrs open), drag stores, super markets and diverse types of restaurants in 1-5mins working distant. no stress in shopping and foods.fridge: no freezer and very compact fridge in the room. given the size of it, you may not expect to keep too many stuffs in it but as mentioned above, supermarket is nearby, so i can easily stop by the supermarket to fulfil your needs at the time of needs.others:  only the negative that i may had with travelodge was the quality of the soundproof. i have to say it is extremely poor as if there is no wall in between your neighbour. this however was not a huge problem with me as i was out for work all day and i’d slept in bed with headsets, but i imagine it could be very frustrating for some people. above all, i am very satisfied with travelodge. concierge is always nice, very attentive and supportive. i had a very pleasant stay here and i’m most likely use it next time again when i come back to hong kong.hope the above helps for to the consideration!",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,,

Receptionist are nice and welcoming.The Room-We got a harbourview room and it was nice.. We got an unobstructed view of the sea which is very calming. The room is clean and well appointed. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Bathroom is spotless and water pressure is good. The Pool-We were informed that we can only book the swimming pool after we checked in. By the time we called the Fitness Center it was already fully booked for the day. There are 12 sessions per day, 50 minutes each, from 8am- 8:50pm and there was no availability.

The staff at the restaurant (Daniel) is amazing and kind.  We really enjoyed our experience with Daniel and the beach.  However, there were a number of issues.  First, the sheets had stains (urine and other unmentionable secretions) and human hair on them, and as soon as I checked in, I needed to get those changed in my child's room.  They changed them but asked a lot of questions before they did (which I thought was really wierd; just change the sheets!).  Then, when I went to sleep in my own room, I found dirt and hair in my bed. Since the staff had gone to sleep, I just slept with the dirt and other people's hair.  The beds were literally hard as a rock and the pillows were also.  We all had a hard time sleeping due to the hardness of the bed and pillows, and other guests we knew who stayed there agreed.  When we woke up and went down for breakfast (which only started at 9 am) it was just okay.  However, what really angered me is that they 1) ask how many people will be at breakfast the next day but do not tell you the breakfast was not included in the price (yes, it's in the fine print in your reservation but every other hotel I've ever stayed in tells you again!); then 2) don't serve breakfast unless you request it,  3) do not state the breakfast price on the menu and 4) surprise you with a bill when you check out for people who are staying there x $80, even if they didn't order breakfast!!

Overall it was a mixed experience, with the view and location being the real highlights but the bathroom being a let-down. I will start with the positives. POSITIVES:1. The views from a balcony room are outstanding. The view is directly over the main beach and across the South China Sea. From our room we were able to see the sea on both sides of the island - it was stunning. During the evening the lights of Hong Kong and Kowloon sparkled in the distance. This was the highlight of our stay.2. Location is very convenient. It couldn't have been better. You are right on the main beach (although having said that, nothing is far from anything in Cheung Chau).3. Even with luggage, it is an easy, flat walk (5-10 min) from the ferry terminal. However there is a steep ramp or steps once you get to the hotel. 3. The balcony is tiny but they are designed to capture maximum view. If staying here, I'd recommend a balcony and sea-view room because this is the main reason for staying here at all. 4. Special 'staycation' deals are frequently on offer during the covid-19 pandemic. 5. Breakfast was very basic but had both Chinese and Western style food on offer. Eggs and omelettes were cooked to order and they did very nice runny eggs when we asked for this. We had breakfast included and went to the breakfast room each day although you can also have it served to your room for a balcony breakfast.6. Wifi was OK for our purposes which was just checking messages etc (not streaming)7. Bed was comfortable and the room was light and bright.NEGATIVES:1. Our bathroom had black mould in the grouting, behind the silicon and on some surfaces like the door. A wooden panel was loose and fell off.  Hot water was good and we had no problem with this but basically the bathroom needs a good overhaul.2. Some maintenance work in the common areas was going on so large areas of carpet are covered in boards and there were several random buckets placed in hallways.3. The room was not made up during our stay. One day, new soap and shampoo appeared in the bathroom but this was the only sign that anyone had been in the room.4. Décor is dated. 5. The fridge was extremely cold and froze milk and champagne but we could not adjust it",0,,,"stunning views but there are some negatives.... we stayed here in a suite for several nights as a ‘staycation’ during the covid-19 pandemic. overall it was a mixed experience, with the view and location being the real highlights but the bathroom being a let-down. i will start with the positives. positives:1. the views from a balcony room are outstanding. the view is directly over the main beach and across the south china sea. from our room we were able to see the sea on both sides of the island - it was stunning. during the evening the lights of hong kong and kowloon sparkled in the distance. this was the highlight of our stay.2. location is very convenient. it couldn't have been better. you are right on the main beach (although having said that, nothing is far from anything in cheung chau).3. even with luggage, it is an easy, flat walk (5-10 min) from the ferry terminal. however there is a steep ramp or steps once you get to the hotel. 3. the balcony is tiny but they are designed to capture maximum view. if staying here, i'd recommend a balcony and sea-view room because this is the main reason for staying here at all. 4. special 'staycation' deals are frequently on offer during the covid-19 pandemic. 5. breakfast was very basic but had both chinese and western style food on offer. eggs and omelettes were cooked to order and they did very nice runny eggs when we asked for this. we had breakfast included and went to the breakfast room each day although you can also have it served to your room for a balcony breakfast.6. wifi was ok for our purposes which was just checking messages etc (not streaming)7. bed was comfortable and the room was light and bright.negatives:1. our bathroom had black mould in the grouting, behind the silicon and on some surfaces like the door. a wooden panel was loose and fell off.  hot water was good and we had no problem with this but basically the bathroom needs a good overhaul.2. some maintenance work in the common areas was going on so large areas of carpet are covered in boards and there were several random buckets placed in hallways.3. the room was not made up during our stay. one day, new soap and shampoo appeared in the bathroom but this was the only sign that anyone had been in the room.4. décor is dated. 5. the fridge was extremely cold and froze milk and champagne but we could not adjust it",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,,

So this review is in that context. Firstly, I was allocated room 11 on floor 18. If you get allocated room 11 don’t accept it, the window is tiny and the room feels like a prison cell. The rooms are ok and the best features are the clean and comfortable bed and the water pressure in the shower. The shower is not large but is sufficient but note that the water takes quite a while to heat up. The room has a TV but the choice of channels is limited, no major international stations to watch. There’s a Bluetooth clock/speaker, Aircon, minibar fridge (empty), closet, safe, tea/coffee/kettle (supplies are limited so you may want to bring your own). A few of points to note:-The hotel is close to a major traffic junction and so if you are sensitive to noise at night beware. There is major construction going on next to the hotel currently with large cranes which operate from around 8am to 6pm on weekdays, I’m not sure about weekends.The hotel seems to charge for everything considered ‘extra’. Currently all bars and restaurants in Hong Kong close at 6pm due to coronavirus restrictions so if you’re on a staycation you need to order a food delivery. If you want the hotel to to provide a plate, knife/fork, wine glass etc, the hotel will charge you. If you want more water bottles than the daily allocation the hotel will charge you. The amounts are not significant but the principle of charging for everything extra is very annoying and outdated; where’s the spirit of customer service in this hotel? It doesn’t seem to exist here. All in all underwhelmed, nothing really strongly positive to report here.

However, I managed to celebrate a memorable Christmas Eve with all my family members at Gloucester Luk Kwok (GLK) Hotel. The HKSAR government announced an extension of social distancing measures until January 6, 2021 just before Christmas. In other words, the current rule about public gatherings (i.e. only two people are allowed to gather in public) and ban on dining services after 6pm remained unchanged during Christmas time and this obviously affected our Seasonal Cheer Staycation Package at GLK Hotel. What is more, the cupcake making class (which was included in our package) was cancelled due to the current social distancing measures. Special thanks should go to Mr. Ray Hon (from the Reservation Department) who suggested to offer us five Fresh Cream Cakes (1 pound each) or Black Forest Cakes (1 pound each) for the replacement of the cupcake making class. After taking the health and needs of our family members into consideration, Ray proposed to upgrade our our five superior rooms to premier rooms on the 25th floor instead of offering five cakes to us. We appreciated Ray’s care of us very much.The change in our room type obviously allowed all ten of us to enjoy room service for our 4-hour “Unique Japanese Cuisine” All-You-Can-Eat Christmas Dinner comfortably in five very spacious and specially decorated rooms. Needless to say, the food was really good but most importantly, I would like to extend my gratitude to the two staff members from Le Menu for their wonderful service provided to my family members throughout the evening. Not only did I need to reserve 5 rooms for my family members to enjoy themselves during Christmas, I had to reserve 5 tables for two for my family so that they could have dim sum on Christmas morning. Thanks to the staff at Canton Room for helping us to reserve 5 tables between 10am and 12noon even though the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Day. The staff were really caring for the fact that their service to us was of the highest quality. The must-eat dishes include assorted dim sum platter, baked mini egg tarts, barbecue pork with liver, beef congee with preserved and salted eggs and fried rice noodles with scallops.",1,"dear 735aal,we have taken note of your positive comments which we will share it with all our staff via their department heads. we are grateful to hear your appreciation to our staff in reservations department - mr ray hon, le menu and canton room, all of us at the gloucester luk kwok hong kong are looking forward to being of services to you again in your future visits.best regards, gloucester luk kwok hong kongnow you can enjoy an extra 8% off on lowest available rate from our hotel website for the next visit when you share your experience on tripadvisor, please check your direct message to enjoy this promotion.","Responded December 29, 2020","a merry christmas at gloucester luk kwok hotel during covid-19 pandemic having the opportunity to see all the family members at christmas under the current sets of restrictions to reduce the spread of covid-19 virus was not an easy task at all in hong kong. however, i managed to celebrate a memorable christmas eve with all my family members at gloucester luk kwok (glk) hotel. the hksar government announced an extension of social distancing measures until january 6, 2021 just before christmas. in other words, the current rule about public gatherings (i.e. only two people are allowed to gather in public) and ban on dining services after 6pm remained unchanged during christmas time and this obviously affected our seasonal cheer staycation package at glk hotel. what is more, the cupcake making class (which was included in our package) was cancelled due to the current social distancing measures. special thanks should go to mr. ray hon (from the reservation department) who suggested to offer us five fresh cream cakes (1 pound each) or black forest cakes (1 pound each) for the replacement of the cupcake making class. after taking the health and needs of our family members into consideration, ray proposed to upgrade our our five superior rooms to premier rooms on the 25th floor instead of offering five cakes to us. we appreciated ray’s care of us very much.the change in our room type obviously allowed all ten of us to enjoy room service for our 4-hour “unique japanese cuisine” all-you-can-eat christmas dinner comfortably in five very spacious and specially decorated rooms. needless to say, the food was really good but most importantly, i would like to extend my gratitude to the two staff members from le menu for their wonderful service provided to my family members throughout the evening. not only did i need to reserve 5 rooms for my family members to enjoy themselves during christmas, i had to reserve 5 tables for two for my family so that they could have dim sum on christmas morning. thanks to the staff at canton room for helping us to reserve 5 tables between 10am and 12noon even though the restaurant was fully booked on christmas day. the staff were really caring for the fact that their service to us was of the highest quality. the must-eat dishes include assorted dim sum platter, baked mini egg tarts, barbecue pork with liver, beef congee with preserved and salted eggs and fried rice noodles with scallops.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,

In the past 8 months, I stayed in Taiwan, Thailand and Myanmar due to  my work.In fear and  for a long journey, I decided to return to my original place: Hong Kong. I was absolutely delighted, staying in the first isolation hotel for 14 days. After another month, I decided to move and look around for a hotel that suits me better!Under the Covid 19 epidemic, my requirements for hotels are air circulation and cleanliness in the rooms! I am satisfied with the work of the room cleaners! It's just that under the epidemic, the management knows the cleaners about the bacteria of Covid 19! The floor of the room is designed with carpets (and the supply of slippers is stopped!), people will pay attention to the cleaning workers who wear shoes and work in the room to bring bacteria.

However, after our experience this time, we will certainly never come back. When I checked in, I asked the staff, Mr. Dennis Dulay, if it is possible for us to have the same room that we had before as we really liked it. He explained that it was an upgrade to a Deluxe Room at that time, and I only booked a Superior Room this time. He said the hotel has upgraded us twice already and he cannot give any more upgrades this time. After consulting with my boyfriend, I informed Mr. Dulay that I will continue the check in, and he assigned me to Room 1247, which he said is a Superior Room. Upon entering Room 1247, it was clearly much smaller than the rooms we stayed in before. I checked my room booking on Trip.com, as well as Regal Kowloon Hotel’s official site, and found out that the Superior Room was advertised as 28sqm (301sqft). This room was clearly much smaller than 28sqm. I had measuring tape in my luggage as we were going furniture shopping recently, and upon measuring the room which was rectangular, it was 3.3m on the window side and 6m from the door to the window. That means the room size is 19.8sqm, almost 100sqft smaller than advertised! I immediately called Reception to clarify; however, the phone rang for 15 mins straight without anyone answering (from around 5:40pm – 5:55pm). Even the phone operator picked up twice to apologize for the long waiting. It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon, so I could not understand why Reception staff can be so busy that they cannot pick up the phone for 15 mins. I called again at around 6:40pm and was finally able to reach a Reception staff. I explained that upon checking the room size and photos as advertised on the website, it is clear that the room I am in is much smaller and not the room type advertised. The staff insisted that the room is 28sqm, despite clear evidence on my end that it could not be. He then said he will get back to me. Around half an hour later, Mr. Dulay and another staff came to the room to discuss. At this point, Mr. Dulay’s attitude was very unpleasant. He insisted that the hotel cannot keep giving us upgrades, that “you only booked the cheapest room” and “you cannot have no comment when you get a bigger room but complain when you get a smaller room”. The issue here is not about whether I get any upgrades. I am perfectly happy to stay in a Superior Room if the Superior Room is the same size as advertised. However, if the hotel has falsely advertised the room size and it ends up almost 100sqft smaller, then it is only fair and legal that we get a room which is the same size as what we paid for. Mr. Dulay ended the conversation by saying he will give us an upgrade this time but will mark down in my file that I will never have any more upgrades if I come to this hotel again. Throughout the whole conversation, Mr. Dulay and the other hotel staff have not once apologized for the false room advertising. Mr. Dulay’s tone and attitude was extremely unpleasant. He treated me like a criminal who consistently harasses the hotel for upgrades and nitpicks at small details to get an upgrade. Nowhere in the conversation did Mr. Dulay welcome me back to the hotel again. I perfectly understood and accept that I could not be upgraded this time; however, this is clearly a major issue for misleading consumers to pay for a 28sqm room, and then giving them a 19.8sqm room. When we entered Room 507, the room smelt strongly of cigarettes and was clearly poorly maintained. On most of the nights during our one week stay, the bathtub drain kept gurgling loudly throughout the night. The sounds went on and off and kept repeating for the whole night. One night, it was so loud that my boyfriend and I were kept awake till around 2am, when we were finally able to fall asleep from exhaustion. We considered informing the hotel about this, but when we remembered Mr. Dulay’s poor attitude, we did not want to raise the issue just for Mr. Dulay to say that we were asking for more upgrades again. We did not trust that the hotel would deal with the issue and decided to tolerate it until we leave. I hope the management of Regal Kowloon Hotel can fix this false advertising issue as well as train staff better on customer service, especially when dealing with an issue that is the hotel’s fault.",1,"dear guest,thank you for taking the time to review your stay.i am sorry to learn your unpleasant experiences and the room size was not up to your expectation during your stay.i have reviewed the case with concerned department heads in order to look for improvement accordingly.we look forward to having another chance to welcome you back again.regardschristo diamandopoulosgeneral manager","Responded March 22, 2021","unpleasant staff and false advertising on room size (almost 100sqft smaller) my boyfriend and i stayed in regal kowloon hotel for 2 times before, each time for a week, and it’s always been a smooth experience. however, after our experience this time, we will certainly never come back. when i checked in, i asked the staff, mr. dennis dulay, if it is possible for us to have the same room that we had before as we really liked it. he explained that it was an upgrade to a deluxe room at that time, and i only booked a superior room this time. he said the hotel has upgraded us twice already and he cannot give any more upgrades this time. after consulting with my boyfriend, i informed mr. dulay that i will continue the check in, and he assigned me to room 1247, which he said is a superior room. upon entering room 1247, it was clearly much smaller than the rooms we stayed in before. i checked my room booking on trip.com, as well as regal kowloon hotel’s official site, and found out that the superior room was advertised as 28sqm (301sqft). this room was clearly much smaller than 28sqm. i had measuring tape in my luggage as we were going furniture shopping recently, and upon measuring the room which was rectangular, it was 3.3m on the window side and 6m from the door to the window. that means the room size is 19.8sqm, almost 100sqft smaller than advertised!

Wanted to check the differences between the rooms as the names of rooms on hotels.com and their website are different and quite confusing, so emailed the hotel directly and received prompt replies. Upon arrival, an upbeat friendly doorman greeted and helped with my suitcases. It was important for me to have late check-out as my flight was at 11pm, they have policy that guests can pay 50% of the daily room rate for guaranteed late check-out. My booking on hotels.com included guaranteed late check-out at 2pm (instead of normal 12 noon), paying 50% of the daily room rate for extra 4 hours didn't seem like a great deal. I was lucky enough to have manager Maven served me at reception, I asked him whether there are any other options. Basically for almost the same price as the 50% of the daily room rate, I had a room upgrade, with the addition of breakfasts at Playt, Lounge Access with afternoon tea and cocktail, plus guaranteed late check-out at 6pm, this was a far better deal so I went with that. I preferred harbour view which Maven tried to accommodate the best he could. When I got to the room, I thought there will be a bathtub but there was none, so I headed back down and he managed to find me a room basically with everything I had hoped for. There was renovation in the room below with external bamboo framework, he went to check that this didn't block the view before he gave me the room and also let me know about such. Have to say I was extremely impressed with Maven's professionalism, had stayed at quite a few places all over the world and it is not often that you feel that staff genuinely cares about guests and goes above and beyond but I definitely felt this with the services that Maven provided.The room I had was the Deluxe Executive Room, the room wasn't huge but with a nice bathtub and rain shower, comfortable bed. Everything very nice and new since the room was one of the recently renovated ones. My only complaint is the green chair was extremely uncomfortable to sit in. Breakfast at Playt and the afternoon tea on 26/F were alright, a little disappointed but not a big deal. Ordered room service one night, had the Wonton noodles, it came quickly and was lovely. Also went up to Skye during both day time and night time, the view overlooking Victoria Park, the harbour and Tin Hau is simply spectacular. Staff are friendly and helpful. I wanted to weigh my suitcases, one of the luggage staff came up to my room and helped weighed all my suitcases which was extremely helpful. I also needed 2 documents printed,  emailed them to the reception and they printed right away and even brought it to my room. Have to say all round top notch services provided by the staff.

Not only because I could benefit from the ALL membership, but also because of the homely experience I receive whenever I stay here.Checking in was hassle-free, with Gigi handling the whole process very smooth and professional. Originally booked for the Premium Deluxe Room, but Gigi kindly upgraded us to the newly refurbished Premium Pullman Room, which includes a spectacular view of the Victoria Harbour. Shortly after I entered the room, I received a personalized welcome card from the Loyalty Service Team and also a fruit flatter, which makes me feel very warm and elated. But when my companion arrived at the hotel and examined the room, he was a bit disappointed when the room does not include a bathtub. We therefore went to the front desk again and luckily we were able to receive another upgrade of our room from the reception, which allowed us to enjoy our stay in the very stylish Deluxe Executive Room.With the included dining credit from our package, we patronized the SKYE restaurant which is located on the top floor of the hotel. We were lucky to be seated at the window side, which allowed us to enjoy the spectacular night view of the Victoria Park during our mealtime. The quality of the food was superb. I especially enjoyed the signature cocktails and their beef wellington. However, the service of the restaurant has room for improvement, as the staff could hardly notice us while we want to take an order, even when my companions tried to make eye contacts with the staff, still no one intended to approach us, and I somehow find it rather rude to raise my hand to call the waiter over for any requests we are about to make every time.The buffet breakfast was sumptuous, with a wide range of selection of food such as cereals, salad and even dim sum and Chinese noodles. My companion and I enjoyed the breakfast very much, and I could proudly say that this is the best buffet breakfast offered among all other Accor hotels in Hong Kong.I was contented and very delighted with the overall experience I had this time on our stay at the Park Lane Hotel. Once again, many thanks to everyone who is working hard behind to help making our staycation a special and memorable one, especially to Ray from PLAYT, who kindly assisted us during our breakfast, and to Cindy from the Loyalty Service Team, who kindly assisted me for the check-out of my room.

From the front desk, executive lounge to the restaurant, your staff are not only professional & speak excellent english, they know what hospitality is and clearly they do have the passion in what they do, in making their guests feel welcomed and special. They deliver a very high standard of service to the guests and I feel very well taken care of during my stay. The highlight of my Staycation was definitely the 4-Course In-Room Dinner, it's AMAAAAAZING! Dinner was served in my room with the harbour view, on a nicely set up table, a bottle of red wine is complimentary for us to enjoy with our meal, the Baked Pastry Seafood Chowder, Salad & Lobster Appetiser, Beef Cheek with Red Wine Sauce, Cheese Baked Scallop with Black Truffle and Potatoes, and the Red Velvet Chocolate Mouse in Love Shape were very delicate. I spent a long time arranging them nicely for taking pictures since I was celebrating my anniversary with my partner, it was indeed an overwhelming moment. I enjoyed every moment dining in my room with my loved one. They even wrote a personalised card signed by the staff wishing us ""Happy Anniversary"". I am beyond impressed by the amount of efforts they put in to make my experience unforgettable!!! It's the little extra effort that has made Park Lane stand out from the crowd, leaving a good experience and memory that is going to last for a long time. I would like to mention a few names of your staff who deserve to be recognised by their professionalism and excellent service. Andy Chiu, the front desk manager who was checking us in when we arrived, he greeted us very well and it was such a perfect touch to start our staycation. Andy explained us very well and sold us an upgrade to a ""Harbour View"" room with the access to the executive lounge and arranged a late check out time for us to maximise our celebration at the hotel. He then escorted us to the lift and wished us a wonderful stay, moments after we got into our room, Andy called us to check with us if everything's alright and to inform us the lounge on the day was at the lobby and reminding us to not forget that we had our In-Room dinner at 1930. It's hard to believe we would receive such amount of attention and service. Roger, the service leader at the lounge who welcomed us well, showed us our seats and then walked us through the snacks and drinks menu. I have to say his service language is impressive, that's definitely a service you'll receive in a premium hotel. The afternoon tea snacks are delicious, small bites but very satisfying! The following day when we went to the executive lounge on the 26th floor, Roger remembered us and gave us a very warm welcome. Another 3 staff who worked that day, Hilary, Jack and Sandy were also true stars, they are very cheerful and professional, they ensure our glasses are always filled and checked with us from time to time if we need something else. All the names that I have mentioned are definitely the asset of the hotel, it's them who made me feel special and want to go back. Please give them recognition that they deserve, I hope to see them again in the future when I go back!

Everything - the suite, the food, the omnipresent hospitality - was perfectly executed, and my family and I managed to create another wonderful “Hyatt holiday memory” despite being unable to do our usual year-end travels.We were very warmly welcomed to the hotel by Director of Rooms Kelvin and Front Office Manager Phyllis when we arrived, and were efficiently shuttled to the Regency Club for our check-in, where we were able to relax with a drink and some snacks, which put us in the right state of mind from the start. The suite was in an excellent condition and our family of four felt very much at home in the spacious, clean and well-designed accommodation. It was great to be able to wake up to the soothing sea-view, and continue to have this feast for the eyes while we enjoyed the breakfast at the Regency Club (yes you could very aptly call this a feast for the senses!). Compliments to the Regency Club team for always being calm, cheerful and accommodating despite a very full house, and special call-out to Steve for his steadfast steerage of the Club front desk at all hours of the day (well, it seemed like all hours of the day since I always see him there!).I also had the opportunity to finally meet Godfrey who had very helpfully sorted out our room reservations prior to our arrival, and was always diligently surveying the lobby, ready to smooth out any wrinkles if any appeared. I am a beneficiary of his expertise (as Guest Experience Manager) since we all had an outstanding experience during our short but sweet stay!The highlight of our stay has to be our dinners at Sha Tin 18. The food was excellent as usual - the restaurant’s specialities of Peking duck, roasted pork rice (prepared a la table - what a treat!) and Dongguan cuisine - were expertly cooked, but what stood out was Sebastian's (Assistant F&B Director) very personal hospitality. He made the pre-arrival arrangements (and very graciously accommodated my numerous request), curated the menu for us both nights that we were there to ensure that we had the best of the diverse menu, and discreetly checked in throughout our dinner despite the hectic full house (I was very impressed to see him and Benson (F&B Director) down in the trenches with the rest of the service staff throughout the dinner service!). Despite living in Hong Kong Island and having (more convenient) access to many great restaurants, it is the “extra mile” from Sebastian, Benson and the F&B team that will keep us coming back again and again (if we can secure a table at your very popular restaurant, that is!), Thank you once again for a really wonderful end to a very unusual and at times trying year … we are looking forward to our next visit when we can load up on the delectable delicacies at Sha Tin 18 before (or after) burning off the calories with an exhilarating bike ride right by your doorstep, and then having a restful night in an inviting suite.

You have families just waiting like in an airport sitting on bags. - offer them water, coffee, chance to sit at the terrace area while waiting would all improve the often chaotic front area.

Debating between the Sheraton Tung Chung, the Auberge and the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin, we decided to go with the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin.I am not going to say there was no hesitation, taking into account the age of the property (over 10+ years) and negative reviews here on TA, where possibly 9 people would end up disappointed – but we took a leap of faith which I am thrilled to say was the best choice for us.Whilst the property does need a refresh/refurbishment, considering the rate being paid and the offering for the rate (we took 1x 2-bedroom suite, 2x Club rooms – one of which was subsequently upgraded to a Deluxe club – rates included club access and breakfast), we felt this was fair.

Went to Hyatt Centric and Hyatt Regency Tsim Sha Tsui and I must say they are very hospitable no matter which Hyatt hotel you go to! I was very impressed with the efficiency of this hotel in particular, the queue arrangement of the swimming pool. Although I checked-in on a Wednesday, it was still busy at the hotel due to summer vacation. But they still manage to maintain great efficiency!Prior to checking in, I always wondered whether I would get the chance to swim and I actually did! They require you to go to the fitness centre 30 mins in advance prior to the next pool session to reserve your seat. Their arrangement was so quick and simple, I didn't have to wait to get the ticket nor wait to enter the pool. Very smooth indeed.The lunch buffet at the Cafe with my family was splendid! Lots of delicious choices! Staff there were really friendly too! Among the 3 Hyatt hotels I went to, I think this one was the best one. Last but not least, I really want to sincerely thank the Guest Experiences Team for treating my Dad a nice birthday treat, he had a nice, enjoyable stay at the hotel.  I really appreciate the effort especially the hand-written card. At first I thought it would just be a generic printed birthday wish card to actually find out it was hand-written. I really appreciate it! It's the thought the counts! Kuddos to Hera & Michelle from the Guest Experiences Team for preparing this. Though we did not meet, I genuinely appreciate the effort. Shout out to Matthew and Nicholas from the Front Desk for being really efficient and hospitable during check-in!   Just a comment on room cleanliness & condition, better pay attention to the sides of bed and crevices as there some hair & dust found when I entered the room. This felt short of my expectation as the other Hyatt hotels performed well in terms of cleanliness. Also, I think the management could consider replacing better curtains in the toilet as when you pull them down, it goes down in one go. I thought I broke the curtains. I'm used to the ones that go down slowly as you pull it down. Otherwise, everything else was excellent!

I truly appreciate that Shatin 18 offers delivery services during this challenging time. My old parents are reluctant of eating out, and Shatin 18 is one of my dad's go-tos. So, I thought this year would be nice if I order him (+ my mom) a small lunch for delivery so they can enjoy it at home for Father's day. The ordering process was fine until I realized I could not pay online. I called and was informed by the restaurant's manager that I would not be able to pay online? what?! That my parents would have to pay in CASH when they delivered to their lobby. That would be so lame since it was a gift from me. The reason being my credit card wouldn't be processed for 2 days, therefore I would not be able to place the same-day order. Strange! I use the same CC all around the world and had never heard of that. I insisted that I was not wire transferring and CC shouldn't have a delay. No information about ordering 2 days prior if paying by CC on the website either. After 4 phone calls later, I was finally able to just click a link and paid online, and it went right thru. My goodness, what a waste of time! Not only it is ridiculous to offer online food delivery and ask customers to pay by cash ($130US btw), the unnecessary hassle that I had to go through to just prepay the meal is just too much from a big international hotel chain. And come one we are in 2021 right?!2 issues obviously. 1) User experience issue from the web offering to check out. 2) Lack of staff training. They obviously don't know what they are talking about. Since it was apparent that there was a way to just pay online easily, why gave me the run around? (requiring 4 international phone calls) Mr. Wilson Lee, if you are reading this, I urge to you take some time to improve your web offering, check-out process, and provide proper staff training.

The least ""Hyatt"" hotel in Hong Kong","Claiming themselves to be the first international hotel in the New Territories and being one of the very few teaching hotels in Hong Kong, the overall performance was regrettably disappointing. Received an email few days prior to my arrival to introduce the opening hours of hotels facilities and restaurants, as well as the reservation for the evening cocktail at the Regency Club. AFMO Lorraine Yiu did offer prompt responses to my emails but sadly cannot secure me a table at Shatin 18.The view from the room was quite nice, especially if you booked a Tolo habour view room or suite. The benefit of locating far away  from urban is its spacious rooms and suites.The maintenance and cleanness of rooms are unsatisfactory. It was hard to believe the hotel was only operated from around 10 years. Facilities were old and they had the oldest TV, that with a thick border frame, I had ever seen in a hotel. Grand Hyatt HK (I know it is not fair to GH to have them as a comparison), operates for over 30 years, has even better maintenance works than Hyatt Shatin.Service level was another great disappointment. I understand it is hard to constantly ensure a seamless service, so I make this review after a number of visits and believe it should be representative. In the perspective of  hotel policy, although it is not a luxury-oriented hotel, I still expect there would be something as small as a welcome card, that another Hyatt Regency in TST also did. There was also no turn down service. Nobody came to refill water and tidy up the room in the evening. But I think they would still willing to provide this service by request.Apart from the hotel policy, staffs did not compensate a lot for a better experience, but might even make it worse. Checking in on weekday, there was not many guests, but all courters were occupied. I stood in front of the front desk for 5 minutes with a lot of front office staffs walked by but all ignored me. I am not saying that they had to stop what they were doing, but a short greeting and telling me to wait would be warm enough.The staffs at Cafe Hyatt was a joke. Not to comment on its breakfast quality, what I can share is I indeed had a greater service at McDonald. Being ""warned"" several times as I entered the buffet area through their so-called ""exit"". I asked for the reason, but the staff could not explain and just said it was the rule. Ironically, she also entered through the ""exit"".To be fair, the swimming pool is quite impressive.

The staff are always wonderful, and what some of the younger staff lack in experience and English language skills they make up for in enthusiasm and helpfulness. This staycation was for my annual birthday treat and I was thrilled to be given a complimentary upgrade. That said, there are a few minor issues they could consider addressing.In my room the TV was “getting on a bit.” The more modern hotels now have smart TVs and I missed having access to Netflix and YouTube. The hairdryer was attached low down in the bathroom with one of those curly cables and a button you have to keep pressed in. It wasn’t easy to use, and my thumb kept slipping off the button! I realise that theft is a problem, but they take our credit card numbers, so a discrete note to the effect that if you take it, you pay for it, and a suitable replacement charge would be better than the thumb-fight! I was looking forward to using the jacuzzi / sauna / steam, but they were all closed (Covid, I assume). I would still have stayed there, but this information should have been made available. Also, using the pool was a trial! I went down there, settled down with my book, and bang! cleared our for cleaning. I returned, settled again, and bang! my “session time” was over. All I wanted to do was sit by the pool and relax; sadly, that was not easy. Again, I understand that Covid has made things difficult, but a “pool timetable” in the room would have saved me a lot of bother. That said, once you do settle down, it’s hard to believe that you are in busy Hong Kong, and not on some tropical island. Bliss!The general condition of the hotel is good, and the hotel is always immaculate (even the dust trap on my hairdryer was clean – something I always check, after a friend had her hair set on fire!). But the public toilets are looking dingy, and don’t even have auto flush; the buttons on the lift are getting harder to see, wearing thin from the thousands of tapping fingers (It doesn’t help that these places are so dark, either), and the décor is beginning to look quite dated. I think it’s time for a bit of an upgrade. F&B – I ate in the café and ordered room service. The food was of a high standard and the service excellent. The café can be very noisy, though (wooden floors), so I recommend booking a corner table if you want to talk.

Front office staff were courteous, efficient and flexible in making my stay an enjoyable one. I particularly enjoyed receiving a personalised email before my arrival, to inform me that my 12 noon early check-in and 2pm check-out request were approved. It is great to know that the hotel gives flexibility to its guests given the low occupancy. Thanks to their early check-in approval, the hotel boosted its revenue as I decided to arrive early and have lunch at the hotel restaurant’s (which I wouldn’t have done if I had not been approved early check-in). Lunch buffet is good, quality of the ingredients is what you expect of a five star hotel. Waiters are efficient and attentive. Real napkins are provided, which is what expect of a five star hotel (some hotels give paper napkins which I hate!). The choice of desserts could be improved and table presentation could be better (you don’t have anything to put your plate on, it’s probably gonna damage the wooden table). Breakfast is equally good. Again, all what you would expect of an international five star hotel. One thing missing is the salmon. The hotel could consider adding at the breakfast buffet as other hotels do. In-room dining service is extremely efficient! Probably the fastest I’ve ever experienced. Quality once again is good, nice presentation. In-room dining menu is a bit confusing though. The main menu with all choices is within the guest book, the big menu displayed doesn’t show everything. I don’t know why they don’t just have a single menu. Rooms have no minibar but there is a 24/7 pastry shop open. Items are reasonably priced, especially taking into account that there is no alternative around. The apple tart is the hotel’s signature dessert, definitely try it! Cons are similar to the buffet, there aren’t enough desserts to chose from at the pastry shop except the usual muffins. Swimming pool is huge. Pool staff are helpful. A big plus: it’s a heated swimming pool, which I really enjoyed. They have to close it for 10 to 15 disinfection a few times within the day but it doesn’t take long so you can wait outside the pool area and come back once it’s done. Very high hygiene standards, towels all packed in plastic. The only disappointment with the pool is the cleanliness of the chairs. Many of them have stains; that’s the only thing I think needs to improve. Housekeeping is efficient as well, items requested through the operator come very fast. Wifi in the room is fast. There is an option to pay extra for wifi which I didn’t need to do, but I find it a bit outdated in 2021 to tell guests they should pay for faster wifi. Local calls are charged 6HK$ per call; most five star hotels offer local calls free of charge and the hotel should follow suit, there is no point charging local calls. The guest service centre operator is very efficient and promptly understood my request. However, what could improve with operators is personalisation. When requesting them to pick my room service tray, I would appreciate to get a more personal touch by being asked how my meal was, instead of just being told ""we are coming right away."" The operator could greet guests by their personal names and when receiving a wake-up call request, they could ask whether a second wake-up call is needed. Nespresso machine could be added in all rooms, that's what most hotels of this category tend to do.Overall, I was very satisfied staying at the Hyatt Regency Sha Tin and will look forward to my next visit.

It was the first international branded hotel opened in New Territories, and also an integrated teaching hotel. With its proximity close to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, overlooking Tolo Harbour and backed by Kau To Shan, it is very suitable for a resort hotel at this location, slightly far from the city but also close to the natural side. Tempting natural environment, quiet neighbourhood and international hotel, seem a good recipe for a perfect staycation, or is it?My reservation was the staycation package deal, with HKD880 dining credit included. I was planning to try the Peking Duck at Shatin 18, which is so famous and I have always wanted to try. However, to my disappointment, when I tried to call the restaurant to reserve one for mine, I was told that ducking was not served as a takeaway, neither did dim sum and some signature dishes as well. Maybe it was because of quality control or cost issue, but it was my first disappointment.I arrived in the afternoon on Friday, sun was shining through the glass door into the lobby. Natural light accompanies the earthy tone of the lobby provided a very relaxing welcome. Check in was smooth and nice, everything was really in no time, breakfast confirmed and paid upon check in as well.I was assigned a room on 12/F, overlooking the calm water of the harbour and rocky Ma On Shan, and CUHK Med school to my left, indeed the view was very good with nothing blocking my sight. The room was also spacious, especially the design of the bathroom was a surprise. Separate area for different purpose and dressing table, perfect for anyone who wanted to look good before going out for the day or night. There were signs showing the little history of the room, some scratches and marks, but I did not find it troubled me and the room was clean and well-appointed. I liked the soft lighting and balcony-style window of the room.I made some request through mobile application as quite a lot of amenities I needed were not in the room, before I went out for a run to the Science Park along the harbor. When I returned, I found out that things were not delivered probably, most of the items I requested was missing. I had to make a call to the operator and asked for them again. Maybe the person responsible for mobile services overlooked the details I typed? Not exactly a big deal though.For dinner, I have selected Shatin 18 anyway, even though they were not serving the duck. I stopped by Shatin 18 on 4/F after my run to ask for a menu of the restaurant, the lady outside was perhaps busying with some other commitments, just asked me to go online and search for their menu. Surprisingly, until this moment, there was no one telling me the arrangement and food options for dinner within the hotel, not at the front desk, not inside the room, was I supposed to dig out the details myself in order to make good use of the dining credits? After deciding the food that I wanted, I went back to level 4 to make the order, and only at that time, I was told by the busy lady standing outside the restaurant that I should have approached the café on level 1 to make the order. It was my mistake and I immediately apologized to the lady, but she still decided to take my order anyway, highly appreciated!Finally dinner was served and I believe it was unfair to judge the quality of a restaurant by its takeaway. The taste of the food may deteriorate as there were too much transportation between me and the kitchen. But I would say the BBQ pork was still very nice, good taste and texture. The chicken however, was not comparable with the pork, it tasted like frozen meat and did not really have a taste, a bit disappointed for that.The next morning, I was greeted by the sunshine through the window and also looking forward to my breakfast as well. Not sure if you have heard it, but some say the breakfast here has a great variety that worth coming just for the breakfast, even though you are not staying here. And sadly, the rumors did not hold, at all. Choices here were quite limited, and here are some examples. No fresh juice provided; 3 options for cheese; 2 options for cold cut; omelet ingredients: 3; no pancake station (served in a bulk in hot food section); no noodle station. Hot food (western) was limited to the basics, sausage, crispy bacon, egg, ham, hash brown, baked beans, and I think that was it. To be very honest, the breakfast did not have to be the same level as Grand Hyatt (it was unfair as price point were different), but it should not feel like a 3-4 star hotel?I have paid attention to the staff whom I have interacted throughout my stay, but I decided not to mention any of them here. While few of them has provided excellent and heart-warming services, many of them actually made a cold touch to guests. And the responsibility of my disappointment did not solely lay on their shoulders as well, it was not the front line who decided to reduce breakfast options, not the front line to decide not to serve Peking Duck as takeaway and not the front line to make such a confusion in hotel dining options. The management did bear part of the responsibility as well, and result in such a “not-that-glamourous” Hyatt resort of Hong Kong.The hotel has an excellent location and facilities as a resort hotel in Hong Kong, but with these standards and disappointment, I see no reason for locals to visit again sadly.",1,"dear j s,thank you for the review.i am sincerely sorry that your stay experience did not meet the high standards we strive to deliver. rest assured that your comment regarding food options of breakfast buffet will be shared with the respective departments for evaluation to improve our operations and services.  thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. we appreciate the feedback and will use it to fine tune our operations.best regards,wilson leegeneral manager","Responded May 11, 2021","lost its gleam through the years or covid?

The suite is very large (especially for Hong Kong standards) and suitable for long stays as it has a large bedroom with an en-suite bathroom equipped with a bathtub, and a living room with a half bath. The views of Tolo Harbour are great as well.We had access to the club lounge which during COVID times offered an evening cocktail from 4-6PM and breakfast between 6:30-10:30AM.

I immedately ordered one and I would likecto share my three cheers after trying it.  First cheer is the packaging.  The clay pot is strong enough to protect all those luxury ingredients (thick enough for slow cooking to avoid burning the ingredients in the bottom). The vegetable, crispy shrimps and fish skin crisps are kept in separate boxes to ensure their freshness and crispiness. Attention to details. Well done.  Second cheer is about the selection of ingredients. Crispy shrimps and fish skin crisps with salty egg yolks - yummy, trendy, and crispy. Kale is one of the assorted veggie.  Kale has a strong flavor and it enhances the flavor of the Poon choi sauce.   Making this Poon Choi very special. Third cheer is its instruction to reheat and its food factory licence to ensure safe cooking and eating.  Poon choi is seasonal food and many restaurants will overlook the cooking instruction and licensing.  Taking nothing for granted. Tony kitchen has paid special attention in food safety. All in all, this is not only a Poon Choi to Go. It is indeed a Poon Choi to Win.  2020 is winter to food businesses, but winter won’t last forever. I appreciate Tony effort to promote and his hotel and kitchen to go extra miles to create this beautiful Poon Choi.  Keep going and keep fighting.  Proud of your fighting spirit.

My friend was also overjoyed by the efforts Miss Kwong made! It was so sweet of Guest Relations to write a birthday card to us! The excitement was not finished when a birthday cake was delivered to our room by the Hotel!They offered a choice of 2 soft pillows and 1 memory pillow.  One minor hiccup was that I got a stiff neck sleeping on a memory pillow!

We also took the opportunity to share the joy and show our gratitude with one of our best friends by inviting her to join us at Café East.  The “buy-2-get-1-free” package was such a value-for-money treat that we did not miss!On the final day, it was good that we could have late check-out at 3pm.

Overall the experience was ok but a few improvements can be made.The check in was smooth and the lobby is bright and clean. The welcome staff was kind and attentive, offered to put my baggage at the counter while waiting for check in. Edmund who checked me in was attentive and friendly, he explained the details of the package to me. However he told me that we are only allowed to use the club for an hour during the cocktail session (supposedly to have free flow cocktail from 5-8pm) and you can queue again if you want to enjoy more. What a ridiculous arrangement, you should consider to expand your lounge if it is not enough to fit in the guests that you sell the package to. Moreover I’m unhappy that they did not inform us in advance. They can simply drop us an email telling us how they would cope with the people flow so I can also plan ahead. Changing something in our package without informing us in advance but only until the time of check in is totally unsatisfactory. We fortunately got an upgrade to a corner city view room. The room is spacious but the view is blocked by Fire Department Building. The washroom comes with bathtub and separate shower room, and it has washlet, which is very Japanese style. Our room has coffee machine but my friend’s didn’t have (which is also a city view room). Natalie from their guest relationship, and whom I talked to through phone before my stay is extremely polite and kind. She also wrote me a welcome note in the room which is heart-warming. The gym facilities are quite new. It is not big but enough for a quick workout. The pool arrangement is the worst among all the hotels I visited. You need to physically be there to queue and they only allow 10 people to enter per section (1 hour). You need to be there 40 minutes in advance, there were a few groups of guests reached 30 mins in advance but the pool staff told them it is already full for the next section. This was not what Edmund told me. Edmund told me I just need to be there half an hour in advance to make a RESERVATION (my understanding is that we will be on the list). I told the pool staff what I was told and the staff simply said Edmund was wrong, the staff was reluctant to communicate with Edmund despite my multiple requests. Personally I find the staff was rude and impatient, I was talking English to him and when my friend approached, he directed the conversation to my friend in Cantonese, and don’t bother to talk to me anymore. I was the one talking to him and he just felt convenient for him to talk to Cantonese so he stopped communicating to me. I felt disappointed and he was being disrespectful.Edmund did come to apologise after the incident. He was very polite and explained to me the miscommunication, he did make appropriate arrangement for me to get into the pool but we still queued for half an hour for the fairness of other guests.The pool isn’t big but have many sunbathing beds. The wooden floor is dirty. The pool is old and need serious cleaning.At the time of cocktail session, we queued more than 30 minutes to get a seat. I understand the hotel might be busy during the weekend , but what amused me is that the Residence Bar & Lounge is not only a club lounge for hotel guests but also a bar that open to public! It is funny that they managed to arrange a table for outside guests (which they paid), and as an in-house guest we are asked to queue and wait. If you want to earn more money by making your lounge a bar, then don’t sell any package that includes a lounge access. Or why don’t you just call it bar access? So I won’t expect it is a lounge that exclusive for your hotel guests. This also losses the exclusivity that a club lounge shall offer.We did get our table around 5.45pm and they didn’t chase us out after an hour as there is no queue. Personally I think the lounge is well decorated but it is extremely noisy with kids running around and it just looked like Cha Can Ting to me. Breakfast at Cafe East was above the standard. The restaurant has great natural light and the food is delicious. I like their Soya Milk and You Tiao! The female staff with tattoo at noddles bar is rude and impatient. Just to stress, i need to describe her with her appearance because all staffs do not wear nametag, make me hard to identify them.We did enjoy late check out at 3pm as provided under our package. Most of the above are not their staffs' fault. The management could be better.

This property was rebranded and given a massive make-up late last year. It now has an almost southwest feel to it with orange earth tone colours, desert furniture and cacti placed throughout the property. It is a nice look and feel compared to so many of the sterile and drab midrange hotel setups around the city. Reservation was made through booking.com where we found the best rates online. Confirmation was received immediately, check-in went smoothly and timely and we were up to our room in just a few minutes. Lobby area on the 4th floor beyond check-in desk is decorative and relaxing. They have a coffee bar, plenty of small tables, window side seating, a long table with a few games, large screen television as well as a small outdoor seating area. There is also a gym as well as a small outdoor area with a doggie pool. We stayed in one of Figo's Premium Suites, which was a neat little setup. Nothing fancy or upscale. Instead, think cute, quaint with perhaps a bit of a college apartment feel to it. The suite included a small bedroom with desk, closet, a bit of room for luggage, flatscreen TV and a generally comfortable bed. There was also a studio style living room with minimal kitchenette setup including basic cutlery, glasses, bowls, fridge, kettle and espresso machine. You could do some very basic food prep here but not any real cooking. There was a tiny two seater table fixed to the wall, small round coffee table and two seater sofa. To be fair, the sofa cushions were in bad shape, we both found ourselves sinking inward to the middle, meaning only one person could sit properly and it was still not very comfortable. This should be mended for the benefit of future guests. Room included a second flatscreen TV. There were enough electrical outlets, good lighting modes, working A/C, wifi and room safe. Tiny bathroom which separated the living room from the bedroom another clever configuration but might be a tight fit for larger guests. In the end, we felt that suite is a good option for a longer stay option providing more space for guests. The limited kitchenette means that you should expect to dine out or do delivery mostly which is perfectly fine as the Sheung Wan and Sai Ying Pun districts are loaded with quality restaurants, coffee shops and bars.

It takes more than two months to secure a a room like this.  Also, it can only be booked by email with non-cancellation and non-changeable terms. So, make your planning carefully if you want to book themed room like this.This is our first time here, we spent our morning in Ting Kau Beach and evening in Lido Beach. The two beaches are located on the left and right of the hotel, both of which are just 3-minute walking distance away, which is very convenient.There is a shuttle bus travelling between the hotel and Tsuen Wan Station every 10-15 minutes and 2 kilometers+ of walking path down to Sham Tseng. The transportation here is considered as convenient. Those who do not like to dine in the hotel can travel to Tsuen Wan easily.There is even a small shop just beside the lobby. With  alcoholic drinks, cakes, and stuff you need for your staycation... If you are lazy to go out, the price is still reasonable here and there are even two vending machines here.It's not your regular 5-star hotel but The maintenance of the hotel itself is still OK. However, the breakfast can be skipped if you are craving for a full breakfast.Verdict: This hotel is really suitable for couples, spending their day on the beach and the hotel is just a 3-minute walking distance away. The cost? It's asking a merely 350HKD+10% on weekends. For a family?

I booked the hotel and informed that I have a 3 year-old child.  I can't find any toilet seats when I arrived the room.  When I ask for a toilet seat for my child, a housekeeping staff told me it has to be checked.  A while later, she told me there were no toilet seats available and brought me a small potty.  I told her the potty was too small that my child can't fit in.  She said she have to double check again to see if there were any toilet seats for me.  She told me she confirmed that all toilet seats were occupied and couldn't render any more assistance.  I was so disappointed.  How come a hotel was unable to provide a toilet seat even I guest told them there would be a child to use their room?  That is very unprofessional and not caring.  I tried to call their hotline and a friendly staff told me she will handle it for me.

I tried 3 times.  No body answered and no body replied my calls.  The buffet arrangement is not flexible.  As my child was suddenly not feeling well, I tried to change the night buffet for 2 persons to a room service but the hotline staff told me that the hotel did not have this option.  Is this something so difficult to arrange some food to the guests who need to take care of their kids?  For people thinking of staycation there, need to think again.

wish”既酒店，呢度啲staff就唔太配合唔到公司宗旨。借咩無咩，要咩service無咩service。1.special request寫左等於無寫我係酒店官網訂房既時候已經話左要同朋友慶祝生日，我只收到一封cold email話歡迎我又話如果有啲咩special request可以同佢地講。我一早就已經問左會唔會有special arrangement可以比到我地，佢唔答我反而問翻我轉頭。2. 0變通 / 怕麻煩既staff我訂左啲裝飾氣球送貨想佢地幫手收然後等我check in自己拎上房搞，聽電話個staff一聽到就即刻耍手擰頭話‘我地唔會幫你set波架’。我由頭到尾無講過話要佢地set。我再clarify翻淨係幫手收唔使set，職員即刻又好為難咁話無位擺。然後又好似好勉強咁話「如果淨係一袋都可以做比你既」。最精彩係，我check out想寄存行李，佢擺左啲行李入一間房度。根本就唔係無位，只不過係怕麻煩。或者0變通。然後我再問可唔可以幫手雪個蛋糕，然後又即刻推卸責任。‘我地酒店無餐廳所以無雪櫃，你自己雪落房雪櫃啦’。我絕對唔相信酒店一個雪櫃都唔比佢地啲staff。只有啲staff根本唔想幫你。結果寄存行李果陣個staff問我有無野要雪，咁者係其實係有雪櫃…3. 自己垃圾自己帶走check-in 果陣比袋氣球我，個staff竟然叫我記得帶翻啲氣球走。咁我想問，我使唔使自己帶埋房啲垃圾走啊？我究竟係黎行山定staycation？Housekeeping剪爛啲波dum都唔得，要個客自己做埋。4. 不設外借基本文具服務房無較剪咁我點剪爛啲波減輕你地負擔？問你地借膠紙都無得借更可況較剪？第一次住酒店無得借基本文具。真係不禁令我好奇，如果有外地客人黎香港買多左野要pack箱咁點算呢？叫人去附近文具舖買又唔話人知邊度有文具舖…5. 第一時間就拒絕客人我book左staycation package， suppose可以做2點 late check-out。佢一開始同我講12點check out。我禮貌地問佢係咪可以2點check out。個 staff 繼續耍手擰頭好firm好生硬咁 「公司網站寫左subject to hotel’s availability，所以都係要睇翻hotel有無availability」。問題係佢睇都無睇個system就第一時間帶頭盔。跟住佢又即刻好為難咁講 「不過我都可以幫你睇下既…」。結果10秒唔使就話可以1點out。既然做到，點解要咁firm咁彈句disclaimer出黎呢？一係就一路睇一路講，唔係講完先check。成個觀感會差好遠。6. 職員態度惡劣前台職員成個機械人咁。見到人default講hello。但係一做其他野就即刻態度勁差。行李寄存果陣我聽唔到佢問我幾點拎翻啲行李，佢即刻就好惡咁講 「幾點拎翻啲行李啊」。「請問」、「想問翻聲」呢啲字詞完全無。7. lobby無廁所 + 袖手旁觀既職員check out 左同朋友去食飯行下，翻去拎翻行李既時候想順便借個廁所。個 staff 繼續好firm咁 「我地酒店全部樓層都係客房所以無廁所借」。 一間酒店lobby廁所都無不特止，個staff仲完全無同我地講最近邊度有廁所或者幫我地搵廁所。就咁由得個客自己「急」。十分唔專業。8. management對客人投訴既奇怪回應上面提過既雪櫃問題，一開始同我講係因為無雪櫃，後來我指出個矛盾位之後先同我講係因為衛生問題。好似好有道理咁，但係個蛋糕係全新既，會有盒裝住架嘛。-	可能佢驚個蛋糕係我自己整既，然後我中左肺炎，個蛋糕就有肺炎，然後搞到雪櫃其他野都有肺炎。-	又或者佢驚其他人有肺炎然後搞到我個蛋糕有肺炎。-	又或者佢一黎就假設啲客會將食過一半既蛋糕雪落公家雪櫃唔衛生。之但係如果真係咁驚既，連一個完整包裝好既蛋糕都容不下既話，我就建議不如唔好開門做生意啦。到Late check-out問題，同佢地反映前台職員態度問題。答我果個錯晒重點，同我講話好開心佢地同事咁快幫我做到late check-out。而家再clarify多次個問題：你地明明做到，點解一黎就要強硬地、毫無感情地背個disclaimer出黎。如果你地真係做唔到既話先講個disclaimer出黎，又或者語氣人性化啲，令個客feel到你地真心盡左力既話成件事就無問題啦。呢一個point提到既回應唔係即時回應。係我上一個post被del之前，佢地management係呢個平台上面對我1-7點既回應。係時間充足，唔係當面對住黑緊面既客人，客人又無要求無理額外賠償既時候都答成咁…9. 總結老實講，上面大部分都唔係啲咩大問題，但係當所有缺點集齊晒，好難唔令人留意埋其他做得唔好既地方。酒店兩大元素不外乎係硬件配套同服務態度。一係就整翻好啲硬件設施，一黎就提供曬客人所需既野，咁啲客咪唔使用你地service，啲service幾差都無人留意到。Eg. 廁所問題，我打從心底唔相信咁大間酒店連一個公家廁所都無，你開/整個廁所出黎俾人用，啲客咪唔會知道原來你地係咁唔helpful咁冷血囉。如果	貴酒店硬件上有咁多不足而又真係改唔到，就應該要改善下服務態度，多啲從客人角度出發，轉移下客人視線。駁唔到既、係做錯既要道歉就真心啲。覺得自己無做錯既，就搵個好啲既理由同翻客人講，唔好下下比人周到有唔合理既地方，然後再搵第二個唔合理既理由去kum。都唔好無視問題、詐傻扮懵、夾硬理解成個客讚你地。咁樣會焫到個客好㷫，唔好彩既話個客好認真，然後佢就會post篇好長既差評…",0,,,"worst

The Hilton Garden Inn was hidden far away from the main road, but also reachable to the metro. Even if the area wasn’t the most beautiful, the hotel itself was very nice and modern.

Finding the Best Deal? I had booked this 2 night (Tue - Thur) staycation months in advance to get a really good deal. I compared between Disney's own website between Hotels.com and ended up going with Hotels.com for a slightly cheaper rate. The hotel was extremely good in following all the remarks in the booking - 1.) my kids + husband's birthdays all fall in July, 2.) bed guards for both beds.Milking your Annual PassIt's great if you have a premium pass (or even if only ONE person in your family has it) you get all sorts of extra benefits. We had a 25% discount off for dinner and was given a free cake because it was the card holder's birthday. >> mind you we did have to make a reservation in advance and also ask for the hotel to put my kids' names on the cake. The hotel was awesome in all these extra touches like a small little chiffon cake for each kid when we got into our rooms, and then towers in the shape of cakes as turn down service. Checking In We arrived around 2pm and the lobby area was packed! They had a pretty good system of having you register your mobile number and then texting you when it's your turn to go check in. We waited for about 45 min before getting texted and once we got to the reception it was very brisk and smooth. There's plenty to see and do to kill time even around the lobby area (Disney store, TV corner for kids, lots of fun decorations, characters appearing every now and then, staff handing out stickers,  checking out Charts Cafe's snacks, etc.) It was pouring on the day of our check in otherwise I think you can venture straight into the gardens which are absolutely stunning! SwimmingA lot of reviews said booking for swimming timeslot was a pain. I agree and think if it was a one night stay we probably wouldn't have stood a chance. So we were grateful to be given a 10am timeslot for the third day and eventually still able to change it to 8am. Food Options  Mind you we did not book restaurants until the weekend before and almost everything was booked out. We only managed to get breakfasts confirmed (both days at the same restaurant), and on waiting list for dinner. They eventually called us back to confirm a table for dinner @ Dragon Wind for the first night and that was good enough. Tbh the restaurant was not even half full when we left the restaurant at 7:20pm so it IS possible. My recommendation is to only try each restaurant once. If you've got young kids, bring a LOT of snacks, fresh fruits and veggie sticks.Nemo PlayroomI had read a lot of reviews beforehand talking about when to line up... but to be honest, the line on non-park opening days are crazy long, so the best way to get in is to have an early dinner as soon as restaurants open at 6pm and get the kids in there for 15-20 min after meal time. To be honest, the playroom is pretty dry and anything less than 30 min is good enough - and only if it's a rainy day as well otherwise why waste time indoors!  All in all, I think if you lower your expectations, you definitely won't be disappointed hahaha The proximity of the hotel to Disneyland and being able to visit the park in the morning then head back for a short nap before running back for their last show of the day was all worth it!",1,"dear phebe l,thank you for choosing our lodge to be your staycation destination.  we appreciate you valuable time to provide a detailed and candid review of your stay.we are pleased to hear that you had enjoyable time at our property.  for some inconveniences caused at hotel on non-p[ark opening day,  please accept our apologies for letting you down.we look forward to welcoming you back in a re-visit in a not too distant future.best regards,michael locksenior manager, hotel operations","Responded July 26, 2021","do your homework before going seems like disney explorers lodge has been getting some bad rep since the start of summer holidays but hopefully this post will do it some justice. finding the best deal? i had booked this 2 night (tue - thur) staycation months in advance to get a really good deal. i compared between disney's own website between hotels.com and ended up going with hotels.com for a slightly cheaper rate. the hotel was extremely good in following all the remarks in the booking - 1.) my kids + husband's birthdays all fall in july, 2.) bed guards for both beds.milking your annual passit's great if you have a premium pass (or even if only one person in your family has it) you get all sorts of extra benefits. we had a 25% discount off for dinner and was given a free cake because it was the card holder's birthday. >> mind you we did have to make a reservation in advance and also ask for the hotel to put my kids' names on the cake. the hotel was awesome in all these extra touches like a small little chiffon cake for each kid when we got into our rooms, and then towers in the shape of cakes as turn down service. checking in we arrived around 2pm and the lobby area was packed! they had a pretty good system of having you register your mobile number and then texting you when it's your turn to go check in. we waited for about 45 min before getting texted and once we got to the reception it was very brisk and smooth. there's plenty to see and do to kill time even around the lobby area (disney store, tv corner for kids, lots of fun decorations, characters appearing every now and then, staff handing out stickers,  checking out charts cafe's snacks, etc.) it was pouring on the day of our check in otherwise i think you can venture straight into the gardens which are absolutely stunning! swimminga lot of reviews said booking for swimming timeslot was a pain. i agree and think if it was a one night stay we probably wouldn't have stood a chance. so we were grateful to be given a 10am timeslot for the third day and eventually still able to change it to 8am. food options  mind you we did not book restaurants until the weekend before and almost everything was booked out. we only managed to get breakfasts confirmed (both days at the same restaurant), and on waiting list for dinner. they eventually called us back to confirm a table for dinner @ dragon wind for the first night and that was good enough. tbh the restaurant was not even half full when we left the restaurant at 7:20pm so it is possible. my recommendation is to only try each restaurant once. if you've got young kids, bring a lot of snacks, fresh fruits and veggie sticks.nemo playroomi had read a lot of reviews beforehand talking about when to line up... but to be honest, the line on non-park opening days are crazy long, so the best way to get in is to have an early dinner as soon as restaurants open at 6pm and get the kids in there for 15-20 min after meal time. to be honest, the playroom is pretty dry and anything less than 30 min is good enough - and only if it's a rainy day as well otherwise why waste time indoors!  all in all, i think if you lower your expectations, you definitely won't be disappointed hahaha the proximity of the hotel to disneyland and being able to visit the park in the morning then head back for a short nap before running back for their last show of the day was all worth it!",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,

included in the room reservation, Dragon Wind (DW) is your destination..its still set menu... i noticed a couple of items (that we used to order/pay extra for as not part of the choices ) taken off the menu but theres a japanese set included ...by the way, in the 3 F&B outlets, you are encouraged to scan QR codes to peruse the menu, instead of through old school hardcopy menus, ie less cross-contact through said items...smart! ...i assume for non-hotel gsts, walk-ins, breakfast not included, Chart Room Cafe (CRC) now serves breakfast (same choices as in DW) as well...World of Color used to, but now only open from lunch through dinner/closing....for a resort, food quality/portions is acceptable, prices reasonable, in all 3 outlets...my only comment/wish is that CRC's customer demand increases so that she can justify staying open the whole day like before, so guests can drop by anytime to get snacks, specialty coffees/drinks, coz sometimes you really just want something quick but not in a restaurant or from room service, especially if you're staying longer than a night....oh, and room service is still available, including during overnight, albeit limited choices (vs room service menu of HK Disneyland Hotel) ...and if it's not too much, maybe let guests have access to buy popcorn in the Lodge, especially for those who prefer to hang in the hotel vs going into the park for it.....theres a limit capacity for Dewdrop Pool, increased cleaning schedule as well..and since the Lodge is only accepting room reservations for the weekends, thus results to high/full occupancy, in order for the Lodge tobe able to accomodate interested guests, you need to reserve a time slot once per day/stay so that the they can evenly distribute pool usage time/capacity...fair enough...the pool and its clean surroundings remain as fun, peaceful and relaxing as its looked and been since the Lodge opened......theres an area in the Oceania Gardens where lawn chairs are set up for guests to relax in, maybe order some wine & snacks to watch the sunset (reasonably priced, trust me)..you can have a badminton area set up... scooters can be rented out for kids (& kids-at-heart?) to 'scoot' on the paths along the gardens...whoever came up with this area/idea really has the guests in mind, ie making sure that they really feel that resort atmosphere when on the grounds outside of their rooms ..am I right, Joe? ;) ...disney characters are still around, eg we got to say goodbye to Mickey as he waved from the balcony just above the lobby, still being able to have that 'character greeting' picture with guests, in this social-distancing world we live in......although we still have to stay in the ever popular ADVENTURER'S SUITE (maybe one day someday when its actually available when we are), everything else is more or less the same, still fun for the kids & adults, from when were there last, especially the big sized rooms, large comfy beds, the rainshower....and of course the Lodge's castmembers, starting from the staff looking like safari guides at the entrance, and the housekeeping staff (in their uniform that always reminds me of Belle's blue & white outfit)...everybody always has a smile &or friendly greeting no matter what time the day....as such, its my pleasure to give a the usual shout out to those who assisted+took care of us during 3D2N, ie those who are basically the same 'friends' we've met/interacted with in previous visits...if you're lucky to meet them, be rest assured that you are in good hands of caring staff who genuinely provide excellent customer service:"" Thank you, Karl & Ivy (reception) , Yan and Raymond (DW), Neville, Ivy and Mike (WOC), Calli/Brianna (Gst Services), KC in the lobby, housekeeping/security staff we met

ballroom dancing performance you've ever seen (just kidding, JF..haha)...seriously, ""THANK YOU very much JOE FUNG"" for possibly going above and beyond duties to ensure me & family really enjoyed but

order/pay extra for as not part of the choices ) taken off the menu but theres a japanese set included ...by the way, in the 3 f&b outlets, you are encouraged to scan qr codes to peruse the menu, instead of through old school hardcopy menus, ie less cross-contact through said items...smart! ...i assume for non-hotel gsts, walk-ins, breakfast not included, chart room cafe (crc) now serves breakfast (same choices as in dw) as well...world of color used to, but now only open from lunch through dinner/closing....for a resort, food quality/portions is acceptable, prices reasonable, in all 3 outlets...my only comment/wish is that crc's customer demand increases so that she can justify staying open the whole day like before, so guests can drop by anytime to get snacks, specialty coffees/drinks, coz sometimes you really just want something quick but not in a restaurant or from room service, especially if you're staying longer than a night....oh, and room service is still available, including during overnight, albeit limited choices (vs room service menu of hk disneyland hotel) ...and if it's not too much, maybe let guests have access to buy popcorn in the lodge, especially for those who prefer to hang in the hotel vs going into the park for it.....theres a limit capacity for dewdrop pool, increased cleaning schedule as well..and since the lodge is only accepting room reservations for the weekends, thus results to high/full occupancy, in order for the lodge tobe able to accomodate interested guests, you need to reserve a time slot once per day/stay so that the they can evenly distribute pool usage time/capacity...fair enough...the pool and its clean surroundings remain as fun, peaceful and relaxing as its looked and been since the lodge opened......theres an area in the oceania gardens where lawn chairs are set up for guests to relax in, maybe order some wine & snacks to watch the sunset (reasonably priced, trust me)..you can have a badminton area set up... scooters can be rented out for kids (& kids-at-heart?) to 'scoot' on the paths along the gardens...whoever came up with this area/idea really has the guests in mind, ie making sure that they really feel that resort atmosphere when on the grounds outside of their rooms ..am i right, joe? ;) ...disney characters are still around, eg we got to say goodbye to mickey as he waved from the balcony just above the lobby, still being able to have that 'character greeting' picture with guests, in this social-distancing world we live in......although we still have to stay in the ever popular adventurer's suite (maybe one day someday when its actually available when we are), everything else is more or less the same, still fun for the kids & adults, from when were there last, especially the big sized rooms, large comfy beds, the rainshower....and of course the lodge's castmembers, starting from the staff looking like safari guides at the entrance, and the housekeeping staff (in their uniform that always reminds me of belle's blue & white outfit)...everybody always has a smile &or friendly greeting no matter what time the day....as such, its my pleasure to give a the usual shout out to those who assisted+took care of us during 3d2n, ie those who are basically the same 'friends' we've met/interacted with in previous visits...if you're lucky to meet them, be rest assured that you are in good hands of caring staff who genuinely provide excellent customer service:"" thank you, karl & ivy (reception) , yan and raymond (dw), neville, ivy and mike (woc), calli/brianna (gst services), kc in the lobby, housekeeping/security staff we met during our stay""  ...and last but not least, thanks to the man in charge...the man with the silver fox looking pompadour, the man in his cool vest looking like he's just about to give the best ballroom dancing performance you've ever seen (just kidding, jf..haha)...seriously, ""thank you very much joe fung"" for possibly going above and beyond duties to ensure me & family really enjoyed but relaxed through last weekend...you're a good man with a great team behind supporting you..disney is fortunate to have you boys & girls..good job y'all!....and ""mr moriarty, bravo!!""",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

From the moment we arrived, we immediately knew we were in good hands of the team there.  Karl was such an amazing host and showed us the way to our suite, he was very interactive with the children, and also explained the design and features of the suite in great detail.  The suite itself was exceptionally spacious and the decorations were well thought out, and with a lot of hidden surprises for the little ones.  Our package came with in room breakfast as well so it allowed us to slightly sleep in the following day, food was neatly presented and very tasteful!  Our little ones received Mickey Dolls as souvenirs which we truly appreciated!  The suite itself was equipped with premium amenities (tent, Monopoly, an extensive list of DVD's) and entertainment games.  Additional perks included the Disney themed Jeep which brought us directly to/from the amusement park (unlimited trips), and canapés and snacks in our suite.  Moreover, a kid's corner (playroom) was also available beside the restaurant and we took advantage of this after our dinner, the kids had a whole lot of fun before heading to bed.During our stay, we were also warmly greeted by Joe, the Front Office Manager and he was very hospitable and genuine, and despite his busy schedule, we appreciate him taking his time to meet us.All in all, we were truly amazed with our experience and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who intend to visit the park and with a less tense schedule with an one night stay (Highly recommend family and friends to directly reserve for the Adventurous Suite and even the connecting room if traveling with a larger number of guests).

It is adventure-themed. Ocean scent air freshener is used and it smells good. It is well-garnished with chandeliers and many other decorations. During check-in, the staff is very friendly and patient. There are also staff roaming around and proactively offering help to visitors. The toilet in the lobby is very clean. The only thing that I would nitpick about is the size of the lobby and that of the gift shop within it. The gift shop offers fewer items than the gift shops within the Disney park. Although the lobby is bright and spacious, it could be even bigger in my opinion. The room we got is on the top floor (8th) and has two beds. Despite a lack of sea view (instead, it has a view of a certain part of the hotel, a garden and a parking lot), it is still totally fine because of the interior of the hotel room. There is a large wardrobe at the end of the entrance, and on the right is an open sink without a door. Next to the sink is a toilet and a shower enclosed behind a door. If you think having an open sink next to your bed (with a wooden barrier in between) is unbearable, then perhaps this hotel is not for you (not sure about other types of rooms, please do your own research). All of these amenities are neat and tidy. The cleaning products (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) are not in tiny bottles but are in reused bottles fixed within a metal rack inside the shower. Slippers and two bottles of water are gifted. There is also some kind of gifts on the table between the two beds. There are 3-4 power sockets within the room. The television screen is wide and long. Similar to the lobby, the room is also adventure-themed. Overall, the room is up to my standards, and Disney has done a great job.The greatest thing about this hotel is actually the outdoors. The landscape design across the gardens surrounding the hotel is done very well, compared to ordinary premises. Different types of flowers and trees are planted everywhere. At the heart of the hotel is a swimming pool hidden well by foliage. Due to safety measures imposed during the pandemic, the pool only allows 60 people for now. Around the pool is many more trees and bushes and also some boulders. The boulders create a pond, a waterfall and so much more scenery. The greatest thing of all is the part of the garden near the ocean.  It has a breathtaking sea view (although fenced off by the hotel boundaries) and perfectly manicured grass lawns. The lawns have some knolls, which make them even better and more natural. Lounging there under the sun is a very pleasant and memorable experience (especially if you are acclimatized to living in a city and seldom experience nature). Not sure if this is right, but you may ask for scooters to be ridden on the garden paths, and badminton rackets or footballs to be played on the lawns. This is what really qualifies this hotel as a part of the Disneyland ""Resort"". This hotel is really good for families and kids. There are many kids running around the lobby. The hotel is really great overall.",1,"dear kaihom,thank you for your recent stay at our lodge and contributed your valuable time to provide a thorough review regarding your staying experience.we are glad to hear of your pleasant stay at our property enjoying our cast members's hospitality and the lodge's facilities.  it is great to learn that you love our themed landscape design and our outdoor surrounding that embraces the nature.   your delightful stay at our lodge is an enormous encouragement to our teams as our cast members strive every day to provide the best services and accommodation to each of our guest!  thank you!we took good notice of your comments about the lobby size and products offered at our merchandise shop that will definitely be shared with the relevant teams.  we treasure our guests' opinions as indeed they can perfect our services.thanks again for your review and we look forward to welcoming you back in a not too distant future!best regards,michael locksenior manager, hotel operations","Responded April 8, 2021","the hotel is really great overall the hotel lobby is good. it is adventure-themed. ocean scent air freshener is used and it smells good. it is well-garnished with chandeliers and many other decorations. during check-in, the staff is very friendly and patient. there are also staff roaming around and proactively offering help to visitors. the toilet in the lobby is very clean. the only thing that i would nitpick about is the size of the lobby and that of the gift shop within it. the gift shop offers fewer items than the gift shops within the disney park. although the lobby is bright and spacious, it could be even bigger in my opinion. the room we got is on the top floor (8th) and has two beds. despite a lack of sea view (instead, it has a view of a certain part of the hotel, a garden and a parking lot), it is still totally fine because of the interior of the hotel room. there is a large wardrobe at the end of the entrance, and on the right is an open sink without a door. next to the sink is a toilet and a shower enclosed behind a door. if you think having an open sink next to your bed (with a wooden barrier in between) is unbearable, then perhaps this hotel is not for you (not sure about other types of rooms, please do your own research). all of these amenities are neat and tidy. the cleaning products (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) are not in tiny bottles but are in reused bottles fixed within a metal rack inside the shower. slippers and two bottles of water are gifted. there is also some kind of gifts on the table between the two beds. there are 3-4 power sockets within the room. the television screen is wide and long. similar to the lobby, the room is also adventure-themed. overall, the room is up to my standards, and disney has done a great job.the greatest thing about this hotel is actually the outdoors. the landscape design across the gardens surrounding the hotel is done very well, compared to ordinary premises. different types of flowers and trees are planted everywhere. at the heart of the hotel is a swimming pool hidden well by foliage. due to safety measures imposed during the pandemic, the pool only allows 60 people for now. around the pool is many more trees and bushes and also some boulders. the boulders create a pond, a waterfall and so much more scenery. the greatest thing of all is the part of the garden near the ocean.  it has a breathtaking sea view (although fenced off by the hotel boundaries) and perfectly manicured grass lawns. the lawns have some knolls, which make them even better and more natural. lounging there under the sun is a very pleasant and memorable experience (especially if you are acclimatized to living in a city and seldom experience nature). not sure if this is right, but you may ask for scooters to be ridden on the garden paths, and badminton rackets or footballs to be played on the lawns. this is what really qualifies this hotel as a part of the disneyland ""resort"". this hotel is really good for families and kids. there are many kids running around the lobby. the hotel is really great overall.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,,

A really thoughtful gesture that meant a lot!

All the staff at Ebb and Flow were exceptional and it has a great ambience for a lobby bar.  Our room for the night was spotless, comfortable and we loved the contemporary decor.  After a great night's sleep we headed to breakfast.  Again because of the COVID situation there is no breakfast buffet on offer but a full menu cooked to order more then makes up for it.  All the staff were attentive and courteous and it was so nice to chat with the lovely Helen once more.  Check out was smooth and efficient and a big thank you to Casan for taking the time to follow up and answer our enquiries with regard to making future bookings.

Good service but not a luxury experience.,"Some hotels just care about their services and Hyatt Regency Shatin is one of them. This is our 3rd staycation of the month. After our trash experience with JW Marriott, we did not have high hope on this hotel. However, the team just slowly builds up our confidence by every details they attended to. We checked in at around 12:00pm. The lobby was not very busy, but there were two very demanding groups in front of us trying to squeeze out some free goodies. Since we had booked a club-accessing room, so we were arranged to check in at the lounge instead. Lounge was facing the tolo harbour - not the most impressive harbour but the calm water brings extra harmony to the environment. Room was ready shortly after our check in, it was a mountain facing room. The amenity of the room was okay. The bed was a little too soft and the pillows were not excellent. The room and bath are only separated by a glass panel, which will be a great idea if you are getting a habour view room. The pool policy needs a bit improvement though. We were asked to queue up 30 minutes before the pool opening time in person to get an admission ticket to the pool. I understand that the government has tightened the regulations, but it seems a bit troublesome that I have to wait in person. A better arrangement will be through advanced booking and the hotel can confirm pool attendance 30 mins before. Lounge was great and staff were very attentive. Every time we tried to prepare a pot of tea, there will always be someone stepping in to help. One point is taken away from the lounge because they don't serve afternoon tea. We enjoyed the whole 2 hour free flow of wine from 6 - 8 pm with a good selection of cold cuts. After a good night sleep, we woke up to the breakfast at the lounge again. Similar selections of cold cuts as cocktail hours; but they only offered two options for hot food, with very limited tailored options. I would recommend having the breakfast at the lounge since the cafe breakfast offers very similar options, but a lot more crowded. For a staycation, the location is great. It is away from central Hong Kong, and offers convenient connection to the nature. For business and leisure purpose, I think there can be better choices at the Hong Kong island side. The whole experience was very nice. It is for sure a good staycation option if you want to experience something different than the regular busy Hong Kong.",1,"dear kollsman c,thanks for the great review sharing your experience. looking forward to welcoming you again soon!best regards,wilson leegeneral manager","Responded April 26, 2021","beyond expectation. good service but not a luxury experience. some hotels just care about their services and hyatt regency shatin is one of them. this is our 3rd staycation of the month. after our trash experience with jw marriott, we did not have high hope on this hotel. however, the team just slowly builds up our confidence by every details they attended to. we checked in at around 12:00pm. the lobby was not very busy, but there were two very demanding groups in front of us trying to squeeze out some free goodies. since we had booked a club-accessing room, so we were arranged to check in at the lounge instead. lounge was facing the tolo harbour - not the most impressive harbour but the calm water brings extra harmony to the environment. room was ready shortly after our check in, it was a mountain facing room. the amenity of the room was okay. the bed was a little too soft and the pillows were not excellent. the room and bath are only separated by a glass panel, which will be a great idea if you are getting a habour view room. the pool policy needs a bit improvement though. we were asked to queue up 30 minutes before the pool opening time in person to get an admission ticket to the pool. i understand that the government has tightened the regulations, but it seems a bit troublesome that i have to wait in person. a better arrangement will be through advanced booking and the hotel can confirm pool attendance 30 mins before. lounge was great and staff were very attentive. every time we tried to prepare a pot of tea, there will always be someone stepping in to help. one point is taken away from the lounge because they don't serve afternoon tea. we enjoyed the whole 2 hour free flow of wine from 6 - 8 pm with a good selection of cold cuts. after a good night sleep, we woke up to the breakfast at the lounge again. similar selections of cold cuts as cocktail hours; but they only offered two options for hot food, with very limited tailored options. i would recommend having the breakfast at the lounge since the cafe breakfast offers very similar options, but a lot more crowded. for a staycation, the location is great. it is away from central hong kong, and offers convenient connection to the nature. for business and leisure purpose, i think there can be better choices at the hong kong island side. the whole experience was very nice. it is for sure a good staycation option if you want to experience something different than the regular busy hong kong.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,,

Here are the pros and cons:Pros: 1. We enjoy the regular swimming pool, gym, and bicycle (we ride to Shatin). 2. The in-room dinning is very good. The food are better than we expected ( We tried some hotels' in-room dinning and sometimes the food were cold =.=). The food voucher is enough for dinner and breakfast.3. The staff are nice, friendly and helpful.4. The one room suite is big enough and well equipped.5. It is good to have free parking.Cons:1. We remind the staff it is for our wedding anniversary during booking but eventually the hotel didnt give any response even a small piece of cake..........2.  The room is not clean enough (we found the bath is dirty and the towels with hair.......). You know, we expect the hygiene of the room should be very high particularly during COVID-19.3.

I admitted that that was our fault and please accept my apology for preventing this tragedy!On 24/09 We ordered room service to be served at 10:00 and we planned to take a rest for two hours and than having lunch at Shatin 18. Prefect! right? But Hyatt forced us to face the dark side of the world! Cruel enough! 10:30-11:00 we heard some hammering sound from the floors above so we called the guest service many times to rectify the situation but the annoying sound still presisted so I asked the guest service to escalate that issue to the management! But it was just the beginning of nightmare11:01 Ms. Katrina Li, Assistant Front Office Manager called my mobile and promised to escalate to the engineering team management stop the renovation work immediately and only resume after we check out on 15:00 11:09 As there was no improvement in the situation and even worser as the technician worked even harder to finish the task. I contacted Katrina again and she promised to enter the room involved to stop the renovation work personally.11:21 Katrina called up again and confirmed that the engineer would stop the innovation work after restall some critical elements for safety reason.11:40 Twenty minutes elapsed but the hammering sounds had no trend of diminishing and so I got no choice but to call Katrina again and she promised to take drastic action immediately!11:50 Thanks God the final peace come to the room and Katrina knocked at my door to apologize! We were so tired and lost the appetite to dine at Shatin 18 so we cancelled the appointment.14:46 Just before we finished pack up of our luggage the damning sound attacked us again!I enclosed four sound clips of the dialogue between Katrina and me for your reference. Even if you did not understand Cantonese please click and listen to our intonation and you might feel how tired I was and how embrassing and sincere Katrina was! I am not blaming on Katrina as she had tried her very best in an attempt to resolve my issue and for the time being she was polite, honest and professional and I have no hesitation to vote my compliment to Katrina! Good job! If I was forced to pick bone from the egg was Katrina had trusted and believed that engineering team would listen to her and suspend their work!I understand that the hotel front office and engineering team at the backstage are always confronting enemies but it didn't mean that you can bring us in as the scapegoat!Let me tell you the whole engineering team is the only party to blame on this issue in the first place! According to industry practice if there is any renovation work to be done the hotel should inform the customer in advance such that they can have a choice to go or not go. If it is an urgent case they should try to minimize the impact on customer, inform the customer before the commencement of work and to provide certain compensation as courtesy and the customer can have choice to accept or not! However this precautionary measures was not found in Hyatt Regency when we check in on 23/09!Complaint against them was launched since 10:30 for almost TWO hours and despite the effort from Katrina they just threw empty promise but did nothing to improve the situation! They stopped on 12:00 but perhaps just for lunch only! Finally they restarted the work at 14:46 before our departure and broke the promise again! Both the engineering team and the respective management team had to bear the prime responsibility of this!However from macroscopic point of view of view Hyatt Regency Shatin senior management has to bear the sole responsibility of this based on the following arguments:(1) There is a Change Management process and the engineering team should estimate on the possible parties, in our case the hotel guests and the front office, that will be affected and inform them in advance. In the situation of hammering sound they should foresee the vertical and horizontal penetration of the noise  to determine the number of rooms that might be effected but I believe no one can answer my question!(2) The escalation channel of the engineering team seems to be ineffective and frankly speaking non existence as I believed front office had tried to stop the renovation work in a bottom up manner from the engineer to their manager and they just threw out empty promise and ignore the guests in the room!(3) There is a conflict between front office customer service and back office engineering team which was not probably handled by the Hyatt Regency Shatin senior managementHowever as reminded by my wife regarding two similar issues in Hyatt Regency Shatin on 24/09/2020 and Hyatt Regency Tsimshatsui on 06/07/2020 we would suspect that there is a deep rooted problem in the management style of Hyatt Hong Kong area that would like to escalate to your attention!For frequent travellers they will bring their own electric kettle and hair dryer for safety hygiene reason but for one night staycation stay we will leave the electric kettle at home and when we are ordering room service we will ask them to send a pot of hot water together with the food! Fair enough!On 24/09/2020 morning when I ordered food from room service we asked for an additional pot of hot water but they forgot! When we called again they seemed to get annoyed, didn't apologise and just said they will send us another pot. Our impression was they assumed that we should boil the water using the kettle in the hotel room so they thought our request was unreasonable and so the request was neglected!Similar thing happened on 06/07/2020 when we stayed at Hyatt Recency Tsimshatsui when we placed order through room service we asked for a pot of hot water and the gentleman on the other side of the phone said""提提你呀!房裏面有熱水煲!""when translated to English means ""Just to remind you there is a electric kettle inside the room"". We had raised the issue on spot and the manager promised to escalate to the senior management for corrective and preventive measures!Just to remind anyone who is reading this email, this is a five star hotel and service agent should try their best effort to fulfill every reasonable request from their guest. In additional I am placing an order and this pot of water is boudled together with the order and I assume they should have no excuse to refuse or neglect this side order!Imagine that I am at your restaurant and placing an order with an additional pot of hot water will you reject me? The only thing you may say is it is an chargeable item and it is felt enough for me to decide to take this offer or not! Another example is there is a microwave oven on the hotel room why didn't Hyatt refuse to take my order and remind me to go downstairs to an convenience store, buy something and reheat it in oven provided inside the room!Gather all the incidents during my three SHORT stays I have reasons to argue that they are no single or individual issues and are norms deeply rooted and disseminated in Hyatt Regency Hong Kong which should draw immediate attention!

This is my second review of Hyatt Regency Shatin of which I hope you’ll find helpful.The Pro:Hyatt Regency Shatin is conveniently located away for an escape from all the HK hustle and bustle, attractive to day/overnight local and Mainland staycation as well as international city visitors alike. The MELO SPA is of outstanding high quality and relaxing as a treat for the wife or enjoyed as a couple. The Cafe is a nice place for entertaining local and passing through Mainland business visitors alike and the Tin Tin bar for enjoying an evening meet-up with friends. The lunch and evening Buffett offering is of very good value and quality and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Head Chef not only for providing a very good Lobster meal but to also providing a very taste bowl of Cheese Fondue. Perfect!Management has been very accommodating and supportive on one of our past staycations when our young daughter suddenly fell ill with high fever on one of our stays. Thank you.The Con:The reason why I’m giving four instead of five stars on this review:No doubt the property has faced some unprecedented financial challenges over the last couple of months mainly due to the Terrorism by your neighbour CUHK. Petrol bombing and literally burning to the ground University Station MTR. I’d hope, as a Hotel, you are distancing yourself from Terrorists and Violence as any Mainland visitor in my business circles is now considering your property as a no-go-zone. I’m very sorry to say that. Likewise, we were considering to perhaps staying with you on 30th June/1st July but because of the close proximity to an unhinged petrol throwing out-of-control bee-hive we reconsider staying at a safer location for staycation on this occasion. This is not your fault but again I do hope you do not support or accommodate CUHK with preferential rates as they are in no deservance of preferential treatment after causing you losses. Nevertheless it is your decision whom you support and likewise a decision of whom will spend money at the property for guaranteeing your survival in light of the current situation.To be frank, except of the items listed in the Pro Section, I do hope that Jay may improve on the pool-side service: It is painstakingly inattentive, slow and sloppy. This is nothing new and has been going on for at least two years now. As much as I appreciate the dedicated life-guard on duty I’d expect pool staff to be a bit more courteous and pro-active in taking orders, providing water, and supplying cutlery and a napkin with served food which is of good quality.The other thing I wish you can improve on are your package offerings: Do not be mistaken and complacent as Word about Service and Value for Money is spreading fast on Social Media amongst HK Staycation Seekers. No Father’s Day Offering was disappointing more so the front desk follow-up whereupon we decided for staying at ICON Hotel. A lost business opportunity.I also would like you to reconsider your smoking policy on the backyard terrace: I understand it is based on a previous complaint (I understand and emphasize) but likewise I can reassure you that you’ll be losing a two-person lunch dinner twice a month by my friends. Your ground floor terrace is large enough for accommodating compromises. The least I like is running through your restaurant and lobby in wet swimming trunks potentially causing a trip hazard for other guests.Regarding COVID Control Measures: I’m not comfortable eating in your indoor ground floor restaurant at the moment. The reason being is staff laying out plates and cutlery on tables for the next sitting whilst potentially contaminated by airborne particles and foot traffic from the lobby to the backyard. Plates and cutlery should be under UV Light until used for disease risk mitigation.I’m hoping to giving you again five stars on my next review. Thank you for your consideration.",1,"dear theintrepidfox,thanks for the great review sharing your experience. your continued support to hyatt regency has been extremely encouraging! it is our pleasure to receive your kind appreciation of our staff service.we treasure opinions from valuable guests like you. please rest assured that your feedback on pool bar service and hygene measures taken at cafe will be shared with the team for review and improvement.looking forward to welcoming you again soon!best regards,wilson leegeneral manager","Responded July 15, 2020","one more step to go the extra mile.. dear mr chowthank you for your hospitality and accommodating us at our recent stay. this is my second review of hyatt regency shatin of which i hope you’ll find helpful.the pro:hyatt regency shatin is conveniently located away for an escape from all the hk hustle and bustle, attractive to day/overnight local and mainland staycation as well as international city visitors alike. the melo spa is of outstanding high quality and relaxing as a treat for the wife or enjoyed as a couple. the cafe is a nice place for entertaining local and passing through mainland business visitors alike and the tin tin bar for enjoying an evening meet-up with friends. the lunch and evening buffett offering is of very good value and quality and i would like to take this opportunity to thank the head chef not only for providing a very good lobster meal but to also providing a very taste bowl of cheese fondue. perfect!management has been very accommodating and supportive on one of our past staycations when our young daughter suddenly fell ill with high fever on one of our stays. thank you.the con:the reason why i’m giving four instead of five stars on this review:no doubt the property has faced some unprecedented financial challenges over the last couple of months mainly due to the terrorism by your neighbour cuhk. petrol bombing and literally burning to the ground university station mtr. i’d hope, as a hotel, you are distancing yourself from terrorists and violence as any mainland visitor in my business circles is now considering your property as a no-go-zone. i’m very sorry to say that. likewise, we were considering to perhaps staying with you on 30th june/1st july but because of the close proximity to an unhinged petrol throwing out-of-control bee-hive we reconsider staying at a safer location for staycation on this occasion. this is not your fault but again i do hope you do not support or accommodate cuhk with preferential rates as they are in no deservance of preferential treatment after causing you losses. nevertheless it is your decision whom you support and likewise a decision of whom will spend money at the property for guaranteeing your survival in light of the current situation.to be frank, except of the items listed in the pro section, i do hope that jay may improve on the pool-side service: it is painstakingly inattentive, slow and sloppy. this is nothing new and has been going on for at least two years now. as much as i appreciate the dedicated life-guard on duty i’d expect pool staff to be a bit more courteous and pro-active in taking orders, providing water, and supplying cutlery and a napkin with served food which is of good quality.the other thing i wish you can improve on are your package offerings: do not be mistaken and complacent as word about service and value for money is spreading fast on social media amongst hk staycation seekers. no father’s day offering was disappointing more so the front desk follow-up whereupon we decided for staying at icon hotel. a lost business opportunity.i also would like you to reconsider your smoking policy on the backyard terrace: i understand it is based on a previous complaint (i understand and emphasize) but likewise i can reassure you that you’ll be losing a two-person lunch dinner twice a month by my friends. your ground floor terrace is large enough for accommodating compromises. the least i like is running through your restaurant and lobby in wet swimming trunks potentially causing a trip hazard for other guests.regarding covid control measures: i’m not comfortable eating in your indoor ground floor restaurant at the moment. the reason being is staff laying out plates and cutlery on tables for the next sitting whilst potentially contaminated by airborne particles and foot traffic from the lobby to the backyard. plates and cutlery should be under uv light until used for disease risk mitigation.i’m hoping to giving you again five stars on my next review. thank you for your consideration.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,

This really pissed me off, we are your customer, you ( Mr. Danny Szeto) said something like this to his customer, is this is the way a hotel staff treat their Royal customer? Anyway, we are settled for 2:00pm late check-out time.Next day, at 12:35 pm, we went out for lunch and return to hotel around 1:32pm, but our room was lock, cannot open, we try both our keys but still cannot work, so we go to front desk asked the front desk to help us open the room for us. The front desk officer Ms. Rode Ma doesn't trust us that both of our room aren't working, she continues said that she checked on the front desk and the door was active, after few minutes talk, she finally personally come up with us and try both room key by herself as she doesn't trust us at all. After she came up and try out both room key and found out it didn't work, then she called the housekeeping to open the door for us. I was furious for the following:1). Ms. Rode Ma doesn't trust me that both key aren't working, has to personally come up and test it out.2). Ms. Rode Ma should asked the housekeeping to stand by at our room, in case the room can't opened, and housekeeping can immediately open the room for us.3). Ms. Rode Ma should not argued with us, she even said to us (with a smiley face) "" what do you want me to do?, You can called police if you want to "" right after she found out she had make a mistake but didn't admit. I wonder whether the hotel training are aware of staffs attitude, manner ? How fluent the training is conducted?  Why the staff said such a thing to their customer?  In conclusion, I still love to stay in this lovely hotel and I still like the facilities, but the staff should really, really have proper training in order to serve the customer better!Thank you very much for your attention!",0,,,"duty assistant manager treat his customer rudely plus the hotel staff still needs a lot of training! my wife and i are fluently stay in this beautiful hotel as these hotel had a good facilities around. whenever we have extra time, even maybe one day or two, we would like to stay in these hotel, and usually, the hotel staff and the guest relation officer always upgrade us to a better room and we are deeply appreciated!but today, as usual, we check-in for one night stay, when we asked the guest relation officer to late check-out until 4:00pm, the guest relation officer can't make the decision, so she asked for advise from her duty assistant manager, mr. danny szeto.when i pointed out that i am requesting a late check-out at 4:00pm, as two weeks ago, when we stay in the same hotel ( as we are a frequent customer ), the guest relation manager gave us a late check-out until 4:00pm, that is why we are asking the same thing this time. but mr. danny szeto said that this hotel is fully book and cannot allow.we said that he was lying as during coronavirus period, only hong kong resident will stay in these hotel and there is a lot of room left and cannot be fully booked. also, i pointed out that last month i stay at a 5`stars hotel and that hotel also allowed us to stay til 4:00 pm, why he can't?mr. danny szeto said that why don't you go and stay at that hotel if they allowed you to stay until 4:00pm, why you come to this hotel?  this really pissed me off, we are your customer, you ( mr. danny szeto) said something like this to his customer, is this is the way a hotel staff treat their royal customer? anyway, we are settled for 2:00pm late check-out time.next day, at 12:35 pm, we went out for lunch and return to hotel around 1:32pm, but our room was lock, cannot open, we try both our keys but still cannot work, so we go to front desk asked the front desk to help us open the room for us. the front desk officer ms. rode ma doesn't trust us that both of our room aren't working, she continues said that she checked on the front desk and the door was active, after few minutes talk, she finally personally come up with us and try both room key by herself as she doesn't trust us at all. after she came up and try out both room key and found out it didn't work, then she called the housekeeping to open the door for us. i was furious for the following:1). ms. rode ma doesn't trust me that both key aren't working, has to personally come up and test it out.2). ms. rode ma should asked the housekeeping to stand by at our room, in case the room can't opened, and housekeeping can immediately open the room for us.3). ms. rode ma should not argued with us, she even said to us (with a smiley face) "" what do you want me to do?, you can called police if you want to "" right after she found out she had make a mistake but didn't admit. i wonder whether the hotel training are aware of staffs attitude, manner ? how fluent the training is conducted?  why the staff said such a thing to their customer?  in conclusion, i still love to stay in this lovely hotel and i still like the facilities, but the staff should really, really have proper training in order to serve the customer better!thank you very much for your attention!",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,,

Familiar to us were Hong Kong and Singapore with Macau, Taiwan and Laos the new places we visited. We chose the Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong SoHo as our accommodation for our 2 night short stay on Hong Kong Island mainly for its excellent location.  We included Hong Kong in our travel plans so we could enjoy a Grayline HK afternoon and evening tour of Hong Kong Island which culminated with a Dinner cruise on the Bauhinia taking in the Hong Kong Symphony of Lights on Hong Kong Harbour.  Sadly it rained for much of this tour which spoilt the enjoyment at the top of Victoria Peak.  However we enjoyed the experience of the Dinner Cruise and the Aberdeen fishing village boat ride.  The Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong Soho is conveniently located at Sheung Wan Hong Kong, and close to the Macau Ferry Terminal. This was an important factor as our next stopover was our 2 night stay in neighbouring Macau.   The hotel is a very tall building towering a number of its neighbouring buildings in Sheung Wan.We found our guestroom at the Holiday Inn Express had a comfortable bed and reasonable facilities with a good sized writing desk and quite a view of the tall skyscraper buildings of Hong Kong Island and a glimpse of Hong Kong Harbour.   The bathroom was clean with adequate facilities.  The shower unit was very easy to operate.  The hotel provided an electricity adaptor for western appliances in the room which was a good feature. A pleasing experience at the hotel was the breakfasts on both mornings in the Moon Thai Restaurant on level two run independent of the hotel. The restaurant provided an excellent buffet style breakfast which included all the usual western favourites such as eggs, bacon, sausages and baked beans. Also thrown in were a few Asian specialities including noodles and tasty spring rolls.  The decor of the restaurant was modest but tasteful.

I love it so much! What a stunning view!  This hotel is right next to / below the Ting Kau Bridge. There's seaview with the Tsing Ma Bridge at a distance. This is not the end. There's long long Castle Peak Road in the front of the hotel. Five minutes walk from the hotel bring you to Lido Beach. About the location, it's very quiet as only roads around it. I saw quite some guests staying here went out early in each morning for jogging along the shore / high speed main road (Castle Peak Road). During my 4 nights' stay, I ever walked to Tsuen Wan West Station (an hour) where many good restaurants and shops are, and Sham Tseng with restaurants famous for roasted goose. There's free shuttle bus between the hotel and Tsuen Wan MTR station (10 mins if no traffic jam, otherwise 20 mins, very frequent every 15 mins). There're some public minibuses and buses to Tsuen Wan city centre where metro is and also Sham TsengI stayed here for 4 nights. Enjoy every moment here. My request for high floor open views was acceded to. The front desk was kind and gave me the top floor (19/F). I booked the sea view room, so the views of my room are fantastic. The interior of room is very good too. Spacious, one more sink outside bathroom which is good. Got all I need including kettle and hairdryer. Bed comfy, air con works well, sound proof. There're restaurants, swimming pool, gym, game rooms and spa. I didn't try any of them though as I was always too busy for so many things to do and try outside eg strolling along the sea, visiting numerous good malls in Tsuen Wan, beaches, exploring adjacent Ting Kau village, watching flyovers and stunning views etc. Price excellent only HKD440 per night excluding breakfast.

We came to this hotel in a relaxed and exciting mood so we understand it suddenly comes a peak period during pandemic issue, but guest should expected you have sufficient experience and resources to handle it well. We have waited around 10 minutes for check in and the front desk staff was not very friendly. What i mostly concerned was the service standard of a hotel in Discovery Bay claimed a 4-star hotel. Also, I am wondering if this hotel with good arrangement, as i know there are some packages has extended late check out until 1pm, but the check in time for other packages is 3pm, do you have any sufficient time and rooms to do this turnover? As the staff told us that they didn't have room available at that moment due to we have requested high floor =.=.

After that, we have asked any late check out can be arranged for us, they told us that they can only arrange for late check out until 12:30pm as they were running high occupancy. I understand that late check out request will be subject to hotel availability but if Hotel is NO IDEA of what time is available for room ready, then, why they announced their check in time is 3pm online? If room cannot be ready at 3pm, I think hotel staff can contact guest in advance, otherwise, it will waste much of the time to wait for a ROOM!If the room need late for us, then we can reschedule of our plan as on that day was raining outside, we have no room and cannot use any facility in the day time at the hotel.

Finally, we have waited more than 2 Hours to get our room at around 5pm, this is out of our expectation, before we can get our room, we have asked the front desk few time for the time which room will ready, they never apologize or compensate. And staff insist to tell us no any late check out to us until next day morning. I am sure that there will be next customer to happen again next. I hope that above comments can assist this hotel to maintain their service quality to serve locally and of course, internationally, it is critical to keep the good impression of Hong Kong to everyone.

Although it’s only a 4 stars hotel, I give the view of this hotel a rating of 5 stars.  However, the service was not impressive.  One of my objective staying here is to really spend some time on meditating, relax, and focusing on myself.  I meditated during afternoon, but that’s when the house keeping came by, during my first day of stay.  I let the housekeeping in, while continuing my meditation.  She came in and out like a tornado, making a lot of noise, and very sloppy cleaning my room.  My meditation was interrupted.  That night I realised my crystal was missing.   I looked for my crystal all night and didn’t know where it went.  So the manager came and looked for the crystal with me, and realized the house keeper unawarely sweep the crystal at the gap of the bed when changing the bedding.

I cannot blamed them for dropping by, but I literally felt pressured like I was being chased for my room to be cleaned, so I asked them to come again in 30 mins.  I think maybe their English wasn’t very good, so no one came by at the end of the day.  So I rang the front desk and asked someone to clean up my room.  The cleaning lady came by and was kind of rude.  I asked her to take off her shoes while entering my room, because this is a critical period.  She said they have to wear shoes, and insist on wearing it.  What she said to me next really surprised me, as it came out from the cleaning lady’s mouth.  She literally just say it to my face the floor are very dirty, so she needs to step into my room with the shoes that she stepped outside the virus dirty floor.

I like the location a lot. the rooms are nice, modern and tidy but the staff I've encountered are generally not very eager to help, provide solution or provide any alternatives, especially the front office which are suppose to help but apparantly not doing so. Generally I'm very understanding regarding hotel experience but to have me write this negative review means I am quite triggered by the continuous mistreat and nonchalant from the front desk. Here are some issues I've had staying in this hotel1. I knew there are noisy renovation work, Ived stayed before during the day. There are rooms that are more far away from the noisy work, which I really appreciate. Until one time, ive been assigned in a room that is too noisy to bear. I gave the front desk a call to request a room change to the other side of the corridor, which is furher away from the noisy work. And the answer I got from a staff was a simple “no, all the rooms are the same” which I knew it wasnt true. A direct no2. I've always asked for a double bed when I check in. The answer is always no, they are full. Even during this time, when the tourism business is not as great, no sure how hey are full. After a few times, I stopped asking.  And they will not tell you the bed type you've given during check in. until you went up to the room and find it out yourself, it is usually a twin. If you called to request a room change for a double bed, expect it to be a no. 3. The application in the TV in each room is not consistent. We enjoy watching netflix in the room but somehow not every TV in their rooms allow you to use that application even when it is installed already. And each time when we check in, we just hope and pray that the room TV has a working netflix. Mostly it is not working. We have talked to the front desk once regarding this issue during one of our stay previously. The solution was to wait until next day because the technician for this Netflix issue would be available the next day. which to me sounds like a complete bs trying to get me off the line. And we just let it go and didnt bother anymore.4. Shower water temperature in the early morning is cold and takes 10 to 15 mins of running water to heat up.5. This triggers me the most, bedding issue again and staff literally dont care. I always book on ctrip. And there are no option to chose a double or twin. I've seen on their official website, there are also no option to choose a twin or double. Like the first point on this review, it is always a no if you request a double. and They will always say your booking is a twin, they are full. Is it because we booked on ctrip and not directly through your website therefore we get this firm denial with zero flexibility everytime and we are seen as lower tier guests? it happens for a few times, okay I understand but it is every single time. Just today I made an extension of my stay in 1706, I called earlier before *noon* in hope to request to change to a double bed and wish that I wont get their standard “we are full you booked a twin answer” and yes I get that again. With no alternatives offered from the front desk after that standard answer, I suggested to have a room that we can combine the bed, that would be fine too. Well it is still a “no, the bed cannot be combined”. The attitude is like stop bothering me, this is what you get, take it or leave it. To sum it up.

This is a very well managed property by the National Hotel Group, offering up spacious, smartly-arranged suites at very affordable rates in Sheung Wan. 99 Bonham has become our favourite place to stay down in the city this year. Worth note, we've found room rates to be better directly on the hotel website compared to what has been made available through various booking websites that we normally use. Reservation confirmations are immediate and payments are processed quickly upon arrival. Staff are professional, helpful, polite and oh so friendly. They are easily the most likeable that we have found at any hotel in Hong Kong in recent years. The three suite types are as advertised. Pictures on the website match exactly what you will find. Lots of space, comfortable beds and nice furnishing, all expected amenities and really impressive views from the floor to ceiling glass windows. Housekeeping is timely and of high standard. There are laundry machines on every other floor, a 1st floor gym and one of Hong Kong's very best (37th floor) rooftops where you can enjoy an evening glass of wine and admire the outstanding views of Hong Kong's famous skyline and parts of Victoria Peak and Harbour. As for location, couldn't be better. The property is just a couple minutes walk from the Sheung Wan MTR entrance and you'll find loads of good restaurants, a few good coffee shops and quality bars in the area.

The staff were nice, and the room is clean and tidy. However, I have an unpleasant checkout experience in my recent stay. The hotel staff called me for the first time around 12:10 and told me that the checkout time is 12:00. I acknowledged it and replied to the staff that I am packing already with an apology. The second call came around 30 minutes later but I missed it. The third call came around 12:50 and the staff asked us to checkout right away as there are guests waiting for the room. In the end, I arrived the reception around 13:20. After returning the room key to Angela Li, the Guest Service Manager on duty, asked me to pay HKD$110 right away without any explanation. I was shocked about it and did not know how does this charge incur. Therefore, I asked for an explanation from Angela. She explained that it is due to the late checkout and had already mentioned in one of the calls. However, I never heard anything regarding the charges. I asked Angela, and another staff, Daisy Hong, whether they can provide black & while terms and conditions regarding the calculation of late checkout charges. Unfortunately, they are unable to provide it. I understand my checkout time is late and willing to pay for the late checkout charges. After I paid, I was surprised that they did not print a receipt for me. Nevertheless, they printed the receipt for me after I ask for it and reminded me to double-check whether I have packed all of my personal belongings or not.All in all, I believe the staff charged me according to the hotel’s standard operating procedures. However, I am a little bit disappointed regarding the service standard.1. Staff ask me to pay HKD$110 at the reception but did not mention the reason for the charges until I ask for clarification2. The staff did not provide the receipt proactively after I paid.3. The staff did not mention about late checkout charges in the calls.4.

We checked in just before midnite. Although the district is a bit dark on the roads, this new hotel glitters like a gem at the back of the buildings. Staff was friendly and efficient. In no time we arrived at our room on high floor. Size of the room and amenities were adequate against its price of below hk$500. Very clean and equipped with the usual bathroom amenities of Hilton from the Crabtree. We tried the breakfast the next morning which was served in the chinese restaurant. Breakfast was in sets with choice of Chinese, western or vegetarian, supplemented with buffet style drinks, bread, fruit and cereal. The taste was only average and I would definitely opt for the 750 points instead next time as not far from the hotel are fast food shops and restaurants selling food of much better taste. However the swimming pool remained closed even the Government had already lifted the ban. Need to mention the staff there were most friendly including the housekeeping staff who greeted us, the restaurant waitresses who cleared our the tables very efficiently, and the front desk staff Mr Howard Au in particular who helped clear my questions. He even called me afterwards to further clarify and ease my concerns. Only later I found out Howard is the Assistant Guest Service Supervisor of the hotel.

The hotel was well-maintained and basically felt secure. To a person, the Front Desk staff were excellent. On a daily basis, before we left the hotel, they would provide advice as to expected large local gatherings and areas we should avoid within the city. Our experience with the hotel's restaurant, however, was not stellar, but the breakfast buffet was excellent. A nice blending of East and West tastes provided a great variety of foods, and made-to-order items were also available. They even brought out gluten free breads for us upon request. We have reviewed the Eagle's Garden Restaurant separately. We understand that the hotel's owner loves the player piano music from the bar area, which was actually quite nice. However, the volume should be lowered so as not to negatively impact conversations taking place at the Front Desk. At times, one needed to almost yell to be heard.

Cast members ushered us into the hotel with waving Mickey hands and Kin welcomed us by name. We were whisked away to our Adventurers Suite where the magic truly came to life. The double doors opened up to an Adventureland Disney attraction. Mickey and Minnie's suitcase lay open in the entry way closet (one of my favorite details) and the pictures and artifacts from their journeys adorn every table and wall. The cast members explained that Mickey and Minnie had gone on a journey, but they have left a chest for us to open. In order to do this, we first needed to decipher the clues found on pieces of a treasure map hidden around the suite. Along with this treasure hunt, Mickey and Minnie left us a special flashlight to use find even more secrets hidden around the room. My husband and I were delighted in the way the cast members stayed in character and brought the whole adventure to life for us! The suite itself is beautifully adorned with every artefact and painting bringing the story to life. The cast member set up treats and fruit upon our arrival and conducted the check in in the dining room. They worked with us to create vegetarian meals, which we greatly appreciated.As part of the perks, we were given pizza, chips, and fries by the pool in a private cabana soon after arrival. They placed an order for us at the Crystal Lotus in the Disneyland Hotel for our take out dinner (Hong Kong does not allow dining in restaurants after 6 due to the pandemic, so the hotel has created take out menus), and then drove us over to the hotel in the Explorers Lodge themed Defender! This is probably one of the best moments of my life. They offered to have it delivered, but I really wanted to ride in the hotel Land Rover. Breakfast the next morning was delivered to our room and beautifully set up. We ate Nemo waffles with the beautiful Hong Kong  horizon as our view. Further amenities include a themed Switch system set up on their very large screen with many complimentary games to play and many Disney movies on Blu Ray to watch. Up is my favorite option of the bunch. The cast even went above and beyond to honor our late check out at guests who have previously stayed on property. Because the Adventurer Suite is so popular, we were not able to stay in the room past eleven, but they did open up another room for us so we could continue to enjoy the hotel amenities until one.

The Land Rover Defender used for picking up guests from MTR station to Disney Explorer Lodge is exotic. It quickly immersed guests into the adventure of unknown.

This warm welcome really made myself feel like home. My journey continued with a quick introduction of surrounding elements and escort to the suite. A special shout out to Front Desk Cast Members who introduced the background story of the Adverturers Suite not only by their words, but also by their acts. Greatly appreciated on their attention to details and their designed dialogs to leave several mysteries for us. A special thanks to F&B & Housekeeping team on their welcome snacks and towel cakes!The room decorations were truly amazing. Entering the room, you would feel like you have entered a basecamp at the centre of Amazon Rainforest but not an ordinary guest-room. I especially like the backstory of the room that could put guests into the room for Mickey & Minnie Mouse, who happened to gone out for another adventure. The first thing that caught my eyes was the huge Mickey & Minnie's suitcase with their belongings and life-sized shoes. The room was also full of their personal collections gathered around the world such as the Jungle River Cruise boat model as well as Maui's magical fish hook. It took us hours to try to photograph all these little hidden tributes to Disney movies and parks. The in-room treasure hunt is fun and yet challenging but the reward of the hunt was worthwhile. The most impressive decoration was the UV effects on the ceiling and the wall since they are truly out-of-expected. I loved all these elements in the room which are suitable for guests of all ages. The interior designs had great impacts on compensating the outdoor view of the room although it is not a great sea view room. The room was spacious and the soundproof of the room was exceptional even it is located right above lobby. In-room entertainments were ample and suitable for larger group especially with Nintendo Switch. The room also offered us Snack Platter by the pool with cabana reserved with great portion and super chill environment.We moved to World Of Color for dinner at night, although I would recommend the hotel could provide a tailored in-room dining menu to let guests could enjoy the time at room, especially with the wooden big dinner table! On the other hand, the breakfast did a great job by directly delivering into the room.

I booked a deluxe room which is very spacious with dining sofa area. The room, and actually the hotel as a whole, looks aged and tired which is quite like the older style 4-star hotel in mainland China. But this is compensated by the great price and the very large space. Cleanliness is acceptable. Bed comfy. Well equipped. I particularly like the large swimming pool. There is gym too. As requested, the staff gave me a room on higher floor (25/F) with very nice and stunning views overlooking the Tin Shui Wai public swimming pool, the hotel's swimming pool, sports ground, basketball court, rows of high rise buildings. There's a Chinese restaurant for dim sum in morning. There's no other choice inside the hotel. There are some shopping plazas (formerly known as Ginza) with some decent restaurants and a cinema. Transport is good as there is bus terminal nearby and light rail station next to it. There are many public leisure places nearby eg Tin Shui Wai park, sports ground, basketball court, swimming pool.
